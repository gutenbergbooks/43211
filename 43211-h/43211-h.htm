<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>The object of this book is to supply teachers and students of English
Economic History with a selection of documents which may serve as
illustrations of their subject. It should be read in conjunction with
some work containing a broad survey of English economic development,
such as, to mention the latest and best example, Professor W.J. Ashley's
"The Economic Organization of England."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The number of historical
"source books" has been multiplied so rapidly in recent years that we
ought, perhaps, to apologise for adding one to their number. We ventured
to do so because in the course of our work as teachers of Economic
History in the University Tutorial Classes organised by the Workers'
Educational Association, we found it difficult to refer our students to
any single book containing the principal documents with which they ought
to be acquainted. That Economic History cannot be studied apart from
Constitutional and Political History is a commonplace to which we
subscribe; and we are not so incautious as to be tempted into a
discussion of what exactly Economic History means. It is sufficient for
our purpose that a subject which is called by that name is being
increasingly studied by University students, and that while the
principal documents of English Constitutional History are available in
the works of Stubbs, Prothero, Gardiner and Grant Robertson, there is no
book, as far as we know&mdash;except Professor Pollard's "The Reign of Henry
VII. from Contemporary Sources"&mdash;which illustrates English economic
development in a similar way. We are far from comparing our own minnow
with these Tritons. But it may perhaps do some service till more
competent authors take the field. It is hardly necessary for us to
apologise for translating our documents into English, and for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>modernizing the spelling throughout. We are likely not to be alone in
thinking that it would be a pity if a passing acquaintance with the
materials of medi&aelig;val economic history were confined to those who can
read Latin and Norman-French.</p>

<p>A word of explanation as to the selection and arrangement of our
extracts may perhaps be excused. Our object was not to produce a work of
original research, but to help students of economic history to see it
more intelligently by seeing it through the eyes of contemporaries.
Hence, though a considerable number of our documents are published here
for the first time, we have not consciously followed the lure of the
unprinted, and have chosen our extracts not because they were new, but
because they seemed to illustrate some important aspect of our subject.
For the same reason we have not confined ourselves entirely to
"documents" in the strict acceptation of that term, but have included
selections from such works as Roger of Hoveden, The Libel of English
Policy, The Commonweal of this Realm of England, Hakluyt's Voyages, and
the Tours of Defoe and Arthur Young, when they seemed to throw light
upon points which could not easily be illustrated otherwise. The
arrangement of our selections caused us some trouble. It is, perhaps,
hardly necessary to urge that a document must be studied with reference
to its chronological setting; and the simplest plan, no doubt, would
have been to print them in strict chronological order. We felt, however,
that the work of all but the more expert readers would be lightened if
we grouped them under definite, even if somewhat arbitrary, headings of
period and subject, and added short bibliographies of the principal
authorities. This seemed to involve the writing of short introductory
notes to explain the contents of each section, which we have accordingly
done. But no one need read them. No one but students beginning the
subject will. If an excuse is needed for stopping with the year 1846, we
must plead that to end earlier would have been to omit documents of the
first importance for the study of modern economic history, and that to
continue further would have caused our book to be even more overburdened
than it is at present.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span></p>

<p>That the attempt to produce in one volume a satisfactory selection of
documents to illustrate English Economic History from the Norman
Conquest to the Repeal of the Corn Laws can hardly be successful, that
we have neglected some subjects&mdash;taxation, colonization, and foreign
trade&mdash;and paid excessive attention to others&mdash;social conditions,
economic policy, and administration&mdash;that every reader will look for a
particular document and fail to find it, of all this we are sadly
conscious. We are conscious also of a more serious, because less
obvious, defect. Partly through a pardonable reaction against the
influence of economic theorists, partly because of the very nature of
the agencies by which historical documents are compiled and preserved,
the natural bias of economic historians is to lay a perhaps excessive
stress on those aspects of economic development which come under the
eyes of the State and are involved in its activity, and to neglect the
humbler but often more significant movements which spring from below, to
over-emphasize organisation and to under-estimate the initiative of
individuals. If a reader of these selections exclaims on putting them
down, "How much that is important is omitted!" we can only confess
ourselves in mercy and express the hope that they may soon be
superseded.</p>

<p>It remains for us to thank those who have helped us with suggestions and
criticisms, or by permitting us to reprint extracts from documents
already published. We have to acknowledge the kind permission to reprint
documents given to us by the Clarendon Press, the Cambridge University
Press, the London School of Economics, the Department of Economics of
Harvard University, The Royal Historical Society, The Early English Text
Society, the Co-operative Union, Ltd., the Controller of H.M. Stationery
Office, the Corporation of Norwich, the Corporation of Nottingham,
Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench and Tr&uuml;bner, Messrs. Duncker &amp; Humblot, Dr.
G. von Schanz, Professor G. Unwin, Professor F.J.C. Hearnshaw, The Rev.
Canon Morris, Miss M.D. Harris, Mr. and Mrs. J.L. Hammond and Mr. F.W.
Galton. Among those who have assisted us with suggestions or in other
ways we must mention Mr. Hubert Hall, Mr. M.S. Giuseppi, Mr. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>S.C.
Ratcliff, all of the Public Record Office, The Ven. Archdeacon
Cunningham, Mr. W.H. Stevenson, of St. John's College, Oxford, Mr. A.
Ballard, Miss Putnam, Mr. R.V. Lennard, of Wadham College, Oxford, Mr.
K. Bell, of All Souls' College, Oxford, Mr. H. Clay, Mr. F.W.
Kolthammer, Miss O.J. Dunlop, Miss H.M. Stocks, and Mr. and Mrs. J.L.
Hammond. For reading our proofs, or part of them, we are indebted to Mr.
E. Barker, of New College, Oxford, Mr. C.G. Crump and Mr. C.H.
Jenkinson, of the Public Record Office, Dr. Knowles, of the London
School of Economics, and Professor G. Unwin, of the University of
Manchester.</p>

<p>We desire especially to express our gratitude to Mr. A.L. Smith, of
Balliol College, Oxford, to whose encouragement it was largely due that
this book was undertaken, and to Professor Unwin, who has not only read
through the whole of it in proof, but by his advice and inspiration has
laid us under an obligation that we cannot easily acknowledge.</p>

<p>The task of reconstructing the economic life of Saxon England is not
easy, and while the document translated below (No. 1) vividly analyses
the obligations and rights of the various classes of tenants and
officers on Saxon estates of the eleventh century, it raises many
difficulties and is probably only true for the more settled parts of the
country. It affords, however, clear proof of a high agricultural and
social development; and though the exact significance of specific terms,
and the status of different classes, may remain obscure, a comparison of
the <i>Rectitudines</i> and the <i>Gerefa</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> with later extents and
custumals, and with Domesday Book itself, establishes the essential
continuity of English economic life and customs, notwithstanding the
shock of the Norman Conquest.</p>

<p>The further study of Domesday Book will undoubtedly yield valuable
results supplementing the information derived from Saxon documents.
While it is primarily a supreme example of the defining spirit and
centralising energy of the conquering race, it is also a permanent
record of England before and at the time of the Norman invasion.
Especially,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> perhaps, is this apparent in the detailed descriptions of
the boroughs, which at once set forth Saxon customs and illustrate the
effects of the Conquest. The extracts given below are intended to show
in brief, first, the methods both of the commissioners who conducted the
survey, and of the officials who reduced the information to a common
form;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> second, the fiscal preoccupation of the government; third, the
origin and character of the early borough, especially manifest in the
case of Wallingford (No. 5), and fourth, the different classes of
tenants, free and unfree. Of particular interest are the following
features: the manner of levying the feudal army (No. 6), the evidence of
the looser organisation of the Eastern Counties, and the greater degree
of freedom prevailing among tenants in the Danelaw (Nos. 4 and 8), the
ample franchises that might be enjoyed by a great Saxon prelate (No. 7),
the saltpans of Worcestershire (No. 9), and the gildhall of the
burgesses of Dover (No. 3).</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap"><a name="Rights_and_Duties_of_all_Persons" id="Rights_and_Duties_of_all_Persons"></a>Rights and Duties of all Persons</span> [<i>Rectitudines Singularum
Personarum</i>. <i>Cambridge</i>, <i>Corpus Christi</i>, 383], c. 1000.</p>

<p><i>The Thegn's Law.</i>&mdash;The thegn's law is that he be worthy of his
book-right,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and that he do three things for his land, fyrdfare,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
burhbote<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and bridge-work. Also from many lands a greater land-service
arises at the king's command, such as the deer-hedge at the king's abode
and provision of warships (<i>scorp to fyrdscipe</i>)<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and sea-ward and
head-ward<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and fyrd-ward, almsfee and churchscot, and many other
diverse things.</p>

<p><i>The Geneat's Service.</i>&mdash;Geneat-service is diverse according to the
custom of the estate. On some he must pay land-gafol<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and
grass-swine<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> yearly, and ride and carry and lead loads, work, and
feast the lord, and reap and mow and cut the deer-hedge and maintain it,
build and hedge the burh,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> bring strange wayfarers to the tun, pay
churchscot and almsfee, keep head-ward and horse-ward, go errands far
and near whithersoever he be told.</p>

<p><i>The Cotter's Service.</i>&mdash;The cotter's service is according to the
custom of the estate. On some he must work for his lord each Monday
throughout the year and for three days each week in harvest. On some
he works through the whole harvest every day and reaps an acre of oats
for a day's work, and he shall have his sheaf which the reeve or lord's
servant will give him.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> He ought not to pay land-gafol. It bents him
to have 5 acres; more, if it be the custom of the estate;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> and if it be
less, it is too little, because his work shall be oft required; he shall
pay his hearth-penny on Holy Thursday, as all free men should; and he
shall defend his lord's inland,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> if he be required, from sea-ward and
the king's deer-hedge and from such things as befit his degree; and he
shall pay his churchscot at Martinmas.</p>

<p><i>The Gebur's Services.</i>&mdash;The gebur's services are diverse, in come
places heavy, in others moderate; on some estates he must work two days
at week-work at such work as is bidden him every week throughout the
year, and in harvest three days at week-work, and from Candlemas<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> to
Easter three. If he do carrying, he need not work while his horse is
out. He must pay on Michaelmas<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Day 10 gafol-pence, and on
Martinmas<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Day 23 sesters of barley and two henfowls, at Easter a
young sheep or two pence; and from Martinmas to Easter he must lie at
the lord's fold as often as his turn comes; and from the time of the
first ploughing to Martinmas he must plough an acre every week and
himself fetch the seed in the lord's barn; also 3 acres at boonwork and
2 for grass-earth<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>; if he need more grass, he shall earn it as he
shall be allowed; for his gafol-earth he shall plough 3 acres<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and
sow it from his own barn; and he shall pay his hearth-penny; two and two
they shall feed a hunting-hound; and every gebur shall pay 6 loaves to
the lord's swineherd when he drives his herd to mast. On the same lands
where the above customs hold good, it belongs to the gebur that he be
given for his land-stock<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> 2 oxen and 1 cow and 6 sheep and 7 acres
sown on his yardland; wherefore after that year he shall do all the
customs that befit him; and he shall be given tools for his work and
vessels for his house. When death befals him, his lord shall take back
the things which he leaves.</p>

<p>This land-law holds good on some lands, but, as I have said before, in
some places it is heavier, in others lighter, for all land-customs are
not alike. On some lands the gebur must pay honey-gafol, on some
meat-gafol, on some ale-gafol. Let him who keeps the shire take heed
that he knows what are the ancient uses of the land and what the custom
of the people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Of those who keep the Bees.</i>&mdash;It belongs to the bee-churl, if he keep
the gafol-hives, that he give as is customary on the estate. Among us it
is customary that he give 5 sesters of honey for gafol; on some estates
more gafol is wont to be rendered. Also he must be oft ready for many
works at the lord's will, besides boon-ploughing and bedrips<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and
meadow-mowing; and if he be well landed<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>, he must have a horse that
he may lend it to the lord for carrying or drive it himself
whithersoever he be told; and many things a man so placed must do; I
cannot now tell all. When death befals him, the lord shall have back the
things which he leaves, save what is free.</p>

<p><i>Of the Swineherd.</i>&mdash;It belongs to the gafol-paying swineherd that he
give of his slaughter according to the custom of the estate. On many
estates the custom is that he give every year 15 swine for sticking, 10
old and 5 young, and have himself what he breeds beyond that. To many
estates a heavier swine-service belongs. Let the swineherd take heed
also that after sticking he prepare and singe well his slaughtered
swine; then is he right worthy of the entrails, and, as I said before of
the bee-keeper, he must be oft ready for any work, and have a horse for
his lord's need. The unfree swineherd and the unfree bee-keeper, after
death, shall be worthy of one same law.</p>

<p><i>Of the Serf-Swineherd.</i>&mdash;To the serf swineherd who keeps the inherd<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
belong a sucking-pig from the sty and the entrails when he has prepared
bacon, and further the customs which befit the unfree.</p>

<p><i>Of Men's Board</i>.&mdash;To a bondservant (<i>esne</i>) belong for board 12 pounds
of good corn and 2 sheep-carcases and a good meat-cow, and wood,
according to the custom of the estate.</p>

<p><i>Of Women's Board.</i>&mdash;To unfree women belong 8 pounds of corn for food,
one sheep or 3<i>d.</i> for winter fare, one sester of beans for Lent fare,
in summer whey or 1<i>d.</i></p>

<p>To all serfs belong a mid-Winter feast and an Easter feast, a
ploughacre<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and a harvest handful,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> besides their needful dues.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Of Followers.</i><a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>&mdash;It belongs to the follower that in 12 months he
earn two acres, the one sown and the other unsown; he shall sow them
himself, and his board and provision of shoes and gloves belong to him;
if he may earn more, it shall be to his own behoof.</p>

<p><i>Of the Sower.</i>&mdash;It belongs to the sower that he have a basketful of
every kind of seed when he have well sown each sowing throughout the
year.</p>

<p><i>Of the Ox-herd.</i>&mdash;The ox-herd may pasture 2 oxen or more with the
lord's herd in the common pastures by witness of his ealdorman<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>; and
thereby may earn shoes and gloves for himself; and his meat-cow may go
with the lord's oxen.</p>

<p><i>Of the Cow-herd.</i>&mdash;It belongs to the cow-herd that he have an old cow's
milk for seven days after she has newly calved, and the beestings<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
for fourteen nights; and his meat-cow shall go with the lord's cow.</p>

<p><i>Of Sheep-herds.</i>&mdash;The sheep-herd's right is that he have 12 nights'
manure at mid-Winter and 1 lamb of the year's increase, and the fleece
of 1 bellwether and the milk of his flock for seven nights after the
equinox and a bowlful of whey or buttermilk all the summer.</p>

<p><i>Of the Goat-herd.</i>&mdash;To the goat-herd belongs his herd's milk after
Martinmas Day and before that his share of whey and one kid of the
year's increase, if he have well cared for his herd.</p>

<p><i>Of the Cheese-maker.</i>&mdash;To the cheese-maker belong 100 cheeses, and that
she make butter of the wring-whey<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> for the lord's table; and she
shall have for herself all the buttermilk save the herd's share.</p>

<p><i>Of the Barn-keeper.</i>&mdash;To the barn-keeper belong the corn-droppings in
harvest at the barn-door, if his ealdorman give it him and he faithfully
earn it.</p>

<p><i>Of the Beadle.</i>&mdash;It belongs to the beadle that for his office he be
freeer from work than another man, for that he must be oft ready; also
to him belongs a strip of land for his toil.</p>

<p><i>Of the Woodward.</i>&mdash;To the woodward belongs every windfall-tree.</p>

<p><i>Of the Hayward.</i>&mdash;To the hayward it belongs that his toil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> be rewarded
with land at the ends of the fields that lie by the pasture meadow; for
he may expect that if he first neglects this, to his charge will be laid
damage to the crops; and if a strip of land be allowed to him, this
shall be by folk-right next the pasture meadow, for that if out of sloth
he neglect his lord, his own land shall not be well defended, if it be
found so; but if he defend well all that he shall hold, then shall he be
right worthy of a good reward.</p>

<p>Land-laws are diverse, as I said before, nor do we fix for all places
these customs that we have before spoken of, but we shew forth what is
accustomed there where it is known to us; if we learn aught better, that
will we gladly cherish and keep, according to the customs of the place
where we shall then dwell; for gladly should he learn the law among the
people, who wishes not himself to lose honour in the country.
Folk-customs are many; in some places there belong to the people
winter-feast, Easter-feast, boon-feast for harvest, a drinking feast for
ploughing, rick-meat,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> mowing reward, a wainstick at wood-loading, a
stack-cup<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> at corn-loading, and many things that I cannot number. But
this is a reminder for men, yea, all that I have set forth above.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

Domesday Book, Additamenta, p. 497</i>], 1086.</p>

<p>Here below is written the inquest of the lands, in what manner the
King's barons enquire, to wit, by the oath of the sheriff of the shire,
and of all the barons and their Frenchmen and of the whole hundred, of
the priest, the reeve, six villeins of each town. Then how the manor is
named; who held it in the time of King Edward; who holds it now; how
many hides; how many ploughs on the demesne, and how many of the men;
how many villeins; how many cotters; how many serfs; how many freemen;
how many socmen; how much wood; how much meadow; how many pastures; how
many mills; how many fishponds; how much has been added or taken away;
how much it was worth altogether; and how much now; how much each
freeman or socman there had or has. All this for three periods; to wit,
in the time of King<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> Edward; and when King William granted it; and as it
is now; and if more can be had therefrom than is had.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap"><a name="The_Borough_of_Dover" id="The_Borough_of_Dover"></a>The Borough of Dover</span> [<i>Domesday Book, I, 1</i>], 1086.</p>

<p>Dover in the time of King Edward rendered 18<i>l.</i>, of which money King
Edward had two parts and Earl Godwin the third. On the contrary the
canons of St. Martin had another moiety.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The burgesses gave twenty
ships to the King once a year for fifteen days and in each ship were
twenty-one men. This they did for that he had fully granted to them sac
and soc.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> When the King's messengers came there, they gave for the
passage of a horse 3<i>d.</i> in winter and 2<i>d.</i> in summer. The burgesses,
however, found a pilot and one other assistant, and if need were for
more, it was hired from the messenger's own money.</p>

<p>From the feast of St. Michael<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> to the feast of St. Andrew<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> the
King's truce (that is, peace) was in the town. If any man broke it, the
King's reeve received therefor common amends.</p>

<p>Whosoever, dwelling in the town continually, rendered custom to the
King, was quit of toll throughout all England.</p>

<p>All these customs were there when King William came to England.</p>

<p>Upon his very first coming to England the town was burned, and therefore
the value thereof could not be computed, how much it was worth when the
Bishop of Bayeux received it. Now it is valued at 40<i>l.</i>, and yet the
reeve renders therefrom 54<i>l.</i>, that is, to the King 24<i>l.</i> of pence
which are twenty in the ounce (<i>ora</i>)<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and to the Earl 30<i>l.</i> by
tale.</p>

<p>In Dover there are 29 messuages, from which the King has lost the
custom. Of these Robert of Romney has two, Ralph de Curbespine three,
William son of Tedald one, William son of Oger one, William son of
Tedold and Robert Niger six, William son of Goisfrid three, in which was
the gildhall of the burgesses, Hugh de Montfort one house, Durand one,
Ranulf de Columbels one, Wadard six, the son of Modbert one. And all
these of these houses avow the Bishop of Bayeux as their protector,
donor and grantor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the messuage which Ranulf de Columbels holds, which belonged to an
exile (that is, an outlaw), they agree that half the land is the King's,
and Ranulf himself has both. Humphrey the Bandylegged (<i>Loripes</i>) holds
one messuage wherefrom half the forfeiture was the King's. Roger de
Ostreham made a house over the King's water and has held hitherto the
King's custom. And the house was not there in the time of King Edward.</p>

<p>At the entry of the port of Dover there is a mill which by great
disturbance of the sea shatters almost all ships, and does the greatest
damage to the King and the men; and it was not there in the time of King
Edward. Touching this the nephew of Herbert says that the Bishop of
Bayeux granted to his uncle Herbert son of Ivo that it should be made.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap"><a name="The_Borough_of_Norwich" id="The_Borough_of_Norwich"></a>The Borough of Norwich</span> [<i>Domesday Book, II</i>, 116], 1086.</p>

<p>In Norwich there were in the time of King Edward 1320 burgesses. Of whom
one was so much the King's own (<i>dominicus</i>) that he could not withdraw
nor do homage without his licence; whose name was Edstan. He had 18
acres of land and 12 of meadow and 2 churches in the borough and a sixth
part of a third; and to one church pertained a messuage in the borough
and 6 acres of meadow. This borough Roger Bigot holds of the King's
gift. And of 1238 burgesses the King and the Earl had soc and sac<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
and custom; and over 50 Stigand had soc and sac and commendation<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>;
and over 32 Harold had soc and sac and commendation; of whom one was so
much his own (<i>dominicus</i>) that he could not withdraw nor do homage
without his licence. In all they all had 80 acres of land and 20 acres
and a half of meadow; and of these one was a woman, Stigand's sister,
with 32 acres of land; and between them all they had half a mill and the
fourth part of a mill, and still have; and in addition they had 12 acres
and a half of meadow which Wihenoc took from them; now Rainald son of
Ivo has the same; and in addition 2 acres of meadow which belonged to
the church of All Saints; these also Wihenoc took, and now Rainald has
them. There is also in the borough a church of St. Martin which Stigand
held<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> in the time of King Edward, and 12 acres of land; William de
Noiers has it now as part of the fee of Stigand. Stigand also held a
church of St. Michael, to which belong 112 acres of land and 6 of meadow
and 1 plough. This Bishop William holds, but not of the bishopric. And
the burgesses held 15 churches to which belonged in almoin 181 acres of
land and meadow. And in the time of King Edward 12 burgesses held the
church of Holy Trinity; now the bishop holds it of the gift of King
William. The King and the Earl had 180 acres of land. The Abbot has a
moiety of the church of St. Lawrence and one house of St. Edmund. This
was all in the time of King Edward. Now there are in the borough 665
English burgesses and they render the customs; and 480 bordiers who
owing to poverty render no custom. And on that land which Stigand held
in the time of King Edward there dwell now 39 burgesses of those above;
and on the same land there are 9 messuages empty. And on that land of
which Harold had the soke there are 15 burgesses and 17 empty messuages
which are in the occupation of the castle. And in the borough are 190
empty messuages in that part which was in the soke of the King and Earl,
and 81 in the occupation of the castle. In the borough are further 50
houses from which the King has not his custom.... And in the borough the
burgesses hold 43 chapels. And the whole of this town rendered in the
time of King Edward 20<i>l.</i> to the King and to the Earl 10<i>l.</i> and
besides this 21<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for allowances and 6 quarts of honey and 1
bear and 6 dogs for bear-[baiting]. And now 70<i>l.</i> king's weight and
100<i>s.</i> by tale as gersum to the Queen and 1 goshawk and 20<i>l.</i> blanch
to the Earl and 20<i>s.</i> by tale as gersum to Godric.... Of the burgesses
who dwelt in Norwich 22 have gone away and dwell in Beccles, a town of
the abbot of St. Edmund, and 6 in Humbleyard hundred, and have left the
borough, and in King's Thorpe 1, and on the land of Roger Bigot 1, and
under W. de Noies 1, and Richard de Sent Cler 1. Those fleeing and the
others remaining are altogether ruined, partly owing to the forfeitures
of Earl Ralph, partly owing to a fire, partly owing to the King's geld,
partly through Waleram.</p>

<p>In this borough if the bishop wishes he can have one moneyer....</p>

<p><i>Land of the Burgesses.</i>&mdash;In the hundred of Humbleyard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> always 80 acres
and 14 bordiers and 1 plough and 3 acres of meadow; and they are worth
13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i></p>

<p><i>The French of Norwich.</i>&mdash;In the new borough are 36 burgesses and 6
Englishmen and of yearly custom each one rendered 1<i>d.</i> besides
forfeitures; of all this the King had two parts and the Earl the third.
Now there are 41 French burgesses on the demesne of the King and the
Earl, and Roger Bigot has 50, and Ralph de Bella Fago 14, and Hermer 8,
and Robert the crossbowman 5, and Fulcher, the abbot's man, 1, and Isac
1, and Ralph Visus Lupi 1, and in the Earl's bakehouse Robert Blund has
3, and Wimer has 1 ruined messuage.</p>

<p>All this land of the burgesses was on the demesne of Earl Ralph and he
granted it to the King in common to make the borough between himself and
the King, as the sheriff testifies. And all those lands as well of the
knights as of the burgesses render to the King his custom. There is also
in the new borough a church which Earl Ralph made, and he gave it to his
chaplains. Now a priest of the sheriff, by name Wala, holds it of the
King's gift, and it is worth 60<i>s.</i> And so long as Robert Blund held the
county, he had therefrom each year 1 ounce of gold.</p>

<p>In the borough of Wallingford King Edward had 8 virgates of land, and in
these there were 276 haws<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> rendering 11<i>l.</i> of rent (<i>gablo</i>), and
those who dwelt there did service for the King with horses or by water
as far as Blewbury, Reading, Sutton, Bensington, and to those doing this
service the reeve gave hire or corrody not from the king's revenue
(<i>censu</i>) but from his own.</p>

<p>Now there are in the borough all customs as there were before. But of
the haws there are thirteen less; for the castle eight have been
destroyed, and the moneyer has one quit so long as he makes money. Saulf
of Oxford has one, the son of Alsi of Farringdon one, which the King
gave him, as he says. Humphrey Visdelew has one, for which he claims the
King to warranty. Nigel holds one of Henry by inheritance from Soarding,
but the burgesses testify that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> latter never had it. From these
thirteen the King has no custom; and further William de Warenne has one
haw from which the King has no custom. Moreover there are 22 messuages
of Frenchmen rendering 6<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i></p>

<p>King Edward had 15 acres in which housecarles dwelt. Miles Crispin holds
them, they know not how. One of these belongs to<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> (<i>jacet in</i>)
Wittenham, a manor of Walter Giffard.</p>

<p>Bishop Walchelin has 27 haws rendering 25<i>s.</i> and they are valued in
Brightwell, his manor.</p>

<p>The abbot of Abingdon has 2 acres on which are 7 messuages rendering
4<i>s.</i>, and they pertain to Oxford.</p>

<p>Miles has 20 messuages rendering 12<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>, and they belong to
(<i>jacent in</i>) Newnham, and also one acre on which there are 6 haws
rendering 18<i>d.</i> In Hazeley he has 6 messuages rendering 44<i>d.</i> In Stoke
one messuage rendering 12<i>d.</i> In Chalgrove one messuage rendering 4<i>d.</i>
In Sutton one acre on which there are 6 messuages rendering 12<i>d.</i>, and
in Bray one acre and 11 messuages rendering 3<i>s.</i> there. All this land
pertains to Oxfordshire; nevertheless it is in Wallingford....</p>

<p>Alwold and Godric have the rent (<i>gablum</i>) of their houses and bloodwite
if blood is shed there, if the man should be received within them before
he be claimed by the King's reeve, except on Saturday owing to the
market, because then the King has the forfeiture; and they have the fine
for adultery and theft in their houses; but other forfeitures are the
King's.</p>

<p>In the time of King Edward the borough was worth 30<i>l.</i> and afterwards
40<i>l.</i>; now 60<i>l.</i> And yet it renders of farm 80<i>l.</i> by tale. What
pertains to Adbrei is worth 7<i>s.</i> and the land of Miles Moli 24<i>s.</i> What
the abbot of Abingdon has is worth 8<i>s.</i> What Roger de Laci has, 7<i>s.</i>

<p>When geld was given in the time of King Edward in common throughout the
whole of Berkshire, a hide gave 3&frac12;<i>d.</i> before Christmas and as much
at Whitsuntide. If the King sent an army anywhere, from 5 hides went one
knight only, and for his food or wages 4<i>s.</i> were given to him from each
hide for two months. This money, however, was not sent to the King, but
was given to the knights. If anyone summoned for military service went
not, he forfeited to the King the whole of his land. And if anyone
stayed behind and promised to send another in his place, and yet he who
was to be sent stayed behind, his lord was quit for 50<i>s.</i> A thegn or
knight of the King's own (<i>dominicus</i>) left to the King at death for
relief all his arms and one horse with a saddle and one without a
saddle. And if he had hounds or hawks, they were presented to the King,
that he might receive them if he would. If anyone killed a man having
the King's peace, he forfeited to the King both his body and all his
substance. He who broke into a city by night made amends in 100<i>s.</i> to
the King, not to the sheriff. He who was warned to beat the woods for
hunting and went not, made amends to the King in 50<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The church of St. Mary of Worcester has a hundred which is called
Oswaldslaw, in which lie 300 hides, wherefrom the bishop of that church,
by a constitution of ancient times, has all the profits of the sokes and
all the customs belonging thereto for his own board and for the king's
service and his own, so that no sheriff can have any plaint there,
neither in any plea nor in any cause whatsoever. This the whole county
testifies. These aforesaid 300 hides were of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> demesne itself of the
church, and if anything thereof had been in any wise demised or granted
to any man soever, to serve the bishop therewith, he who held the land
granted to him could not retain for himself any custom at all therefrom,
save through the bishop, nor could he retain the land save until the
completed term which they had determined between themselves, nor could
he go anywhither with that land.</p>

<p>The general characteristics of feudalism as a system by which the
administrative, legislative and judicial functions of the state had
their basis in the tenure of land, are well known. In the following
documents an attempt has been made to illustrate the development of
English feudalism under the direction of a strong central government,
which succeeded in controlling the centrifugal force of feudal
institutions and in establishing a national administration dependent on
the crown and antagonistic to local franchise. By the end of the
thirteenth century the crown was firmly entrenched behind well developed
courts of permanent officials, having at the same time retained its
control of local affairs by preventing the office of sheriff from
becoming hereditary; in the sphere of justice, the central courts of
King's Bench and Common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> Pleas, supplemented by the itinerant Justices
of Assize and by the energy of the Chancellor in devising new remedies
and new legal actions, were slowly but surely undermining the manorial
justice of the greater tenants, a process well understood by the framers
of <i>Magna Carta</i>; while the creation of Parliament brought into being an
institution destined to rival and ultimately to supersede the exclusive
claims of the lords, the feudal council, to advise and control the
crown. While therefore the worst tendencies of feudalism were
neutralised, the sovereign's hold on the land was tightened, and feudal
obligations were reduced to a rigid system which persisted until the
Civil War of the seventeenth century. The administration of this branch
of royal rights, facilitated by the existence of Domesday Book and the
rapid development of the Exchequer, was locally in the hands of the
sheriffs for a century and a half after the Conquest; but the growth of
business, due to the increase of population and the subdivision of the
original knights' fees, necessitated the creation of a separate
official. Already in the time of Richard I., there appears "the keeper
of the king's escheats," and early in the reign of Henry III. the
sheriffs are relieved by the two escheators, one on each side of the
Trent, who answer directly at the Exchequer, although it is not until
the year 17 Edward II. (1323-4) that their accounts are transferred from
the Pipe Roll to a separate enrolment.</p>

<p>The office of escheator passed through a period of experimental
fluctuation during the first half of the fourteenth century; Edward I.
in 1275 temporarily abolished the original two escheatries, dividing the
realm into three stewardships with the sheriffs as escheators in each
county; Edward II. in 1323 divided the country into ten escheatries,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
a plan readopted by Edward III. in 1340; between 1332 and 1340 there
were five escheators, between 1341 and 1357 the office was held by the
sheriffs, though separate patents were issued, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> from 1357 onwards
the office suffered no change of importance until the Tudor period, when
the Court of Wards was established (32 Henry VIII.) and the feodary
appears. The functions of the escheator were to take into the king's
hand and administer the lands of all tenants in chief and of others
whose lands by death, escheat or forfeiture, fell to the crown, to
deliver seisin to the heirs, after taking security for the payment of
relief, to make partitions of lands among heiresses, to assign dowers to
the widows of tenants, and in general to watch over the interests of the
crown in all matters of feudal obligation.</p>

<p>The documents given below show the machinery in operation. Instances are
given of the different tenures<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> (Nos. 1 to 6), while the uncertainty
prevailing in the twelfth century as to the incidents due from land held
by serjeanty is illustrated in No. 5. The gradual substitution of a
money economy for a feudal economy, which finds expression in scutage
(No. 17) and otherwise (No. 18), encouraged an elasticity of tenure
which made a change from serjeanty to knight service (No. 7) and from
personal service to a rent (No. 8) convenient equally to lord and
tenant. The degree to which subinfeudation had commonly proceeded in the
thirteenth century is shown in No. 9, and the burden of the feudal
incidents is exemplified in Nos. 10 to 15. The ordinary revenues of the
Crown from feudal incidents and aids, rents, the profits of justice, and
escheats, were never sufficient to meet emergencies, just as the feudal
army was inadequate for a protracted campaign, and hence the Crown was
forced to resort on the one hand to a universal land-tax (No. 16) or a
limited exaction from the crown demesnes (No. 19), and on the other to a
tax on the feudal unit, the knight's fee (No. 17); the provisions for
the collection of a carucage illustrate the royal determination to exact
the uttermost farthing, while the assessment of a scutage was conducted
on the modern principle of extracting the money first and settling the
liability afterwards. No. 20 is a rare surviving instance of an original
writ <i>Precipe</i> issued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> before <i>Magna Carta</i>, and shows precisely the
method of the royal procedure in attracting legal causes to the King's
jurisdiction out of the hands of the lord. The section concludes with
the important articles of enquiry initiated by Edward I., which led to
the compilation of the Hundred Rolls and the proceedings <i>quo warranto</i>,
and also set out in detail the King's conception of his sovereignty and
of the royal origin of all feudal franchises and liberties (No. 21);
while the last document (No. 22) furnishes a curious instance of one of
the minor royal rights.</p>

<p>The King to his beloved and faithful, Simon de Bereford, his escheator
on this side Trent, greeting. Because we have learned by an inquisition
which we caused to be made by you that Nicholaa, who was the wife of
Nicholas de Mortesthorp, deceased (<i>defuncta</i>), held on the day on which
she died the manor of Kingston Russell with the appurtenances for the
term of her life of the gift of William Russel, and that that manor is
held of us in chief by the service of counting our chessmen (<i>narrandi
familiam scaccarii nostri</i>) in our chamber, and of putting them in a box
when we have finished our game; and that the aforesaid Nicholaa held on
the day aforesaid the manor of Allington with the appurtenances for the
term of her life of Theobald Russel by knight service; and that the
aforesaid Theobald, son of the aforesaid William, is William's next heir
of the manors aforesaid and of full age: We have taken Theobald's homage
for the manor which is thus held of us and have given it back to him.
And therefore we command you, that after you have taken security from
the aforesaid Theobald for rendering to us a reasonable relief at our
Exchequer, you cause the same Theobald to have full seisin of the manor
aforesaid with the appurtenances and of the other lands and tenements
which the same Nicholaa so held for the term of her life of the
inheritance aforesaid in your bailiwick on the day on which she died,
and which on account of her death have been taken into our hand, saving
the right of every man. Witness the King at Gloucester,</p>

Randolf held his land of the King by the service of serjeanty, etc. And
Jollan comes and says that the aforesaid William held no such land of
the lord the King in chief save by the following service, to wit, that
he ought to be verger (<i>portare unam uirgam</i>) before the justices in
eyre at Lincoln, wherefore it seems to him that no wardship pertains
thereof to the lord the King, and he says that at another time he was

Earl had no right in that wardship, and also he says that another
inquisition was made between the lord the King and him, Jollan, whereby
it was proved that the wardship pertained to Jollan, and the inquisition
was delivered to the Chancellor, and he puts himself on that
inquisition, and thereof he says that after the wardship remained to him
by that inquisition he sold the wardship and marriage forthwith to the
Chancellor at Lincoln for 20 marks. And therefore let the inquisition be

Series</i>, iv. 46], 1198.</p>

<p>In the same year Richard, King of England, took an aid of 5<i>s</i>. from
every carucate of land or hide, of the whole of England, for the
collection whereof the same King sent throughout every county of England
a clerk and a knight, who, together with the sheriff of the county to
which they were sent, and with lawful knights elected hereto, after
taking oath faithfully to execute the King's business, summoned before
them the stewards of the barons of that county and from every town the
lord or bailiff of that town and the reeve with four lawful men of the
town, whether freemen or unfree (<i>rusticis</i>), and two of the more lawful
knights of the hundred, who swore that they would faithfully and without
deceit say how many ploughlands (<i>carucarum wannagia</i>) there were in
every town, to wit, how many in demesne, how many in villeinage, how
many in alms granted to men of religion, which the grantors or their
heirs are bound to warrant or acquit, or wherefrom men of religion ought
to do service; and by command of the King they put on each ploughland
first 2<i>s</i>. and afterwards 3<i>s</i>.; and all these things were reduced to
writing; and the clerk had thereof one roll, and the knight a second
roll, the sheriff a third roll, the steward of the barons a fourth roll
of his lord's land. This money was received by the hands of two lawful
knights of each hundred and by the hand of the bailiff of the hundred;
and they answered therefor to the sheriff, and the sheriff answered
therefor by the aforesaid rolls at the Exchequer before the bishops,
abbots and barons appointed hereto. And for the punishment of any jurors
who should conceal aught in this business contrary to their oath, it was
decreed that any unfree man convicted of perjury should give to his lord
his best plough-ox, and moreover should answer from his own property, to
the use of the lord the King, for as much money as he should be declared
to have concealed by his perjury; and if a freeman should be convicted,
he should be at the King's mercy, and moreover should refund from his
own property, to the use of the lord the King, as much as should be
concealed by him, like the unfree man. It was also decreed that every
baron together with the sheriff should make distraints upon his men; and
if through default of the barons distraints were not made, that which
should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> remain to be rendered by their men should be taken from the
demesne of the barons, and the barons themselves should have recourse to
their men for the same. And the free fees of parish churches were
excepted from this tallage. And all escheats of barons, which were in
the hand of the lord the King, paid their share. Serjeanties, however,
of the lord the King, which were not of knights' fees, were excepted;
nevertheless a list was made of them and of the number of carucates of
land and the value of the lands and the names of the serjeants, and all
those serjeants were summoned to be at London on the octave of the Close
of Pentecost, to hear and execute the command of the lord the King. And
those who were elected and appointed to execute this business of the
King decreed, by the valuation of lawful men, 100 acres of land to each
ploughland.</p>

remains to be assessed in our city of London: We appoint you to assess
that tallage in the city aforesaid and the suburb of the same separately

that that tallage be assessed as soon as possible, and the rich be not
spared nor the poor burdened overmuch in this behalf; and that after
that tallage be assessed in the form aforesaid, you deliver estreats
thereof under your seals without delay to our sheriffs of London
separately for that tallage to be levied without delay and paid to us at
our Exchequer; and that you apply such diligence upon the expedition of
the premises that we may deservedly commend you thereupon, in no wise
omitting to appear at the Exchequer aforesaid as soon as you
conveniently can to certify our treasurer and barons of the Exchequer
aforesaid of that which you shall have done in the premises; for we have
commanded our sheriffs of the city aforesaid that when they be
forewarned by you, three or two of you, they cause to come before you,
three or two of you, all those of the city and suburb aforesaid whom
they shall deem necessary for the said tallage, and that they be aiding
and attending to you hereon, as you shall enjoin upon them on our
behalf. In witness whereof, etc. Witness the King at Spalding, 24

<p>The King to the sheriff of Kent, greeting. Because we have been given to
understand that a great mass of a whale lately cast ashore by the coast
of the river Thames between Greenwich and Northfleet in your county,
which should pertain to us as our wreck, and whereof a great part has
been carried away by certain evildoers in contempt of us, remains still
in your keeping, to be delivered to us or others at our command, as is
fitting: We order you, straitly enjoining on you, that you cause all of
the whale aforesaid, which is thus in your keeping, to be entirely
delivered without any delay to our beloved and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> trusty Nicholas de la
Beche, constable of our Tower of London, to be kept to our use, as has
been more fully enjoined on him by us; and that you in no wise neglect
so to do; for we have commanded the same Nicholas to receive from you
that mass, to be kept in the form aforesaid. Witness the King at
Westminster 14 January. By the King himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<h2>SECTION III</h2>

<p class='center'><a name="THE_JEWS" id="THE_JEWS"></a>THE JEWS</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Charter of liberties to the Jews, 1201&mdash;2. Ordinances of 1253&mdash;3.
Expulsion of a Jew, 1253&mdash;4. Punishment for non-residence in a Jewry,
1270&mdash;5. Grant of a Jew, 1271&mdash;6. Ordinances of 1271&mdash;7. Removal of
Jewish communities from certain towns to others, 1275&mdash;8. Disposition
of debts due to Jews after their expulsion, 1290.</p></div>


<p>The documents in the following section illustrate the anomalous position
of the Jews in England, the nature of the royal protection, which
accorded them a security due to them as the king's personal property
(No. 1), the restrictions put upon their religious and social life (No.
2) and upon their possession of land (No. 6), the summary treatment
dealt out to them if they failed to fulfil their function (No. 3), or
dwelt outside the narrow range of a Jewry-town (No. 4), the arbitrary
manner in which they were transferred from person to person, or uprooted
from one town and transplanted (Nos. 5 and 7), and the manner of their
expulsion (No. 8).</p>

<p>Their function in the state was twofold, to supply the crown at any
moment with ready money, and to act as a channel for the conveyance to
the king of the property of his subjects. The degree of their usefulness
must be gauged by the provisions of their charter (No. 1). It is
reasonable to suppose that their expulsion was only determined on when
the crown had drained their resources, or when, as was the case, there
were other supplies available from a class of financiers less obnoxious
to the racial and religious prejudices of the age. The place of the Jews
was immediately occupied by the merchants of Lucca, and later by the
Friscobaldi, the Bardi and Peruzzi and other wealthy societies of
Italian merchant-bankers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

m.</i> 5.], 1201.</p>

<p>John by the grace of God, etc. Know ye that we have granted to all Jews
of England and Normandy that they may freely and honourably reside in
our land, and hold of us all things that they held of King Henry, our
father's grandfather, and all things that they now hold reasonably in
their lands and fees and pawns and purchases, and that they may have all
their liberties and customs as well and peaceably and honourably as they
had them in the time of the aforesaid King Henry, our father's
grandfather.</p>

<p>And if a plaint shall have arisen between Christian and Jew, he who
shall have appealed the other shall have witnesses for the deraignment
of his plaint, to wit, a lawful Christian and a lawful Jew. And if the
Jew shall have a writ touching his plaint, his writ shall be his
witness; and if a Christian shall have a plaint against a Jew, it shall
be judged by the Jew's peers.</p>

<p>And when a Jew be dead, his body shall not be detained above ground, but
his heir shall have his money and his debts; so that he be not disturbed
thereon, if he have an heir who will answer for him and do right
touching his debts and his forfeit.</p>

<p>And it shall be lawful for Jews without hindrance to receive and buy all
things which shall be brought to them, except those which are of the
Church and except cloth stained with blood. And if a Jew be appealed by
any man without witness, he shall be quit of that appeal by his bare
oath upon his Book. And in like manner he shall be quit of an appeal
touching those things which pertain to our crown, by his bare oath upon
his Roll.</p>

<p>And if there shall be dispute between Christian and Jew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> touching the
loan of any money, the Jew shall prove his principal and the Christian
the interest.</p>

<p>And it shall be lawful for the Jew peaceably to sell his pawn after it
shall be certain that he has held it for a whole year and a day.</p>

<p>And Jews shall not enter into a plea save before us or before those who
guard our castles, in whose bailiwicks Jews dwell.</p>

<p>And wherever there be Jews, it shall be lawful for them to go
whithersoever they will with all their chattels, as our own goods, and
it shall be unlawful for any to retain them or to forbid them this
freedom.</p>

<p>And we order that they be quit throughout all England and Normandy of
all customs and tolls and prisage of wine, as our own chattel. And we
command and order you that you guard and defend and maintain them.</p>

<p>And we forbid any man to implead them touching these things aforesaid
against this charter, on pain of forfeiture to us, as the charter of
King Henry, our father, reasonably testifies. Witnesses; Geoffrey Fitz
Peter, Earl of Essex; William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke; Henry de Bohun,

<p>The King has provided and decreed, etc., that no Jew dwell in England
unless he do the King service, and that as soon as a Jew shall be born,
whether male or female, in some way he shall serve the King. And that
there be no communities of the Jews in England save in those places
wherein such communities were in the time of the lord King John, the
King's father. And that in their synagogues the Jews, one and all,
worship in subdued tones according to their rite, so that Christians
hear it not. And that all Jews answer to the rector of the parish in
which they dwell for all parochial dues belonging to their houses. And
that no Christian nurse hereafter suckle or nourish the male child of
any Jew, and that no Christian man or woman serve any Jew or Jewess, nor
eat with them, nor dwell in their house. And that no Jew or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> Jewess eat
or buy meat in Lent. And that no Jew disparage the Christian faith, nor
publicly dispute touching the same. And that no Jew have secret
intercourse with any Christian woman, nor any Christian man with a
Jewess. And that every Jew wear on his breast a conspicuous badge. And
that no Jew enter any church or any chapel save in passing through, nor
stay therein to the dishonour of Christ. And that no Jew in any wise
hinder another Jew willing to be converted to the Christian faith. And
that no Jew be received in any town without the special licence of the
King, save in those towns wherein Jews have been wont to dwell.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>And the justices appointed to the guardianship of the Jews are commanded
to cause these provisions to be carried into effect and straitly kept on
pain of forfeiture of the goods of the Jews aforesaid. Witness the King
at Westminster on the 31st day of January.</p>

<p>The King, etc., to the sheriff of Kent, etc. Know that we caused to be
assessed before us upon Salle, a Jew, a tallage to be rendered on
Wednesday next before Whitsunday in the thirty-seventh year, and because
the same Jew rendered not his tallage on the said day, and on the same
day received a command on our behalf before the justices [appointed to
the guardianship of the Jews] that within three days after the aforesaid
Wednesday he should make his way to the port of Dover to go forth there
with his wife and never to return, saving to the King his lands [rents
and tenements and chattels]: We command you that by oath of twelve [good
and lawful men] you make diligent enquiry what lands [rents and
tenements and chattels] he had on the said day, and who [holds or hold
the same] and how much they are worth, saving the service, etc., and how
much they are worth for sale; and that you enquire also by oath, etc.,
what chattels he had in all chirographs outside the chest, and what they
are worth, and to whose hands they have come, and that you cause
proclamation to be made that none of Salle's debtors hereafter render a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
penny to him,&mdash;let the proclamation be made in every hundred, city,

Trinity.</p>

<p>Devon. Because Jacob of Norwich, a Jew, dwells at Honiton without the
King's licence, where there is no community of Jews, the sheriff is
ordered to take into the King's hand all goods and chattels of Jacob,
and to keep them safely until [the King make other order thereon], and
to have his body before [the justices appointed to the guardianship of

willing to show more abundant grace to the aforesaid Aaron, grant that
in all pleas moved or to be moved for or against him, there be
associated with the justices appointed to the guardianship of the Jews,
on behalf of and by the choice of our son, an assessor to hear and
determine those pleas according to the Law and Custom of Jewry. We have
granted also to the same Jew that by licence of our aforesaid son he may

may buy them, notwithstanding the Provision made of late that no Jew may

10<i>d.</i>].</p>

<p>The King to his beloved and trusty men, his Mayor and Sheriffs of
London, and to all his bailiffs and trusty men to whom [these present
letters shall come], greeting. Know ye that to the honour of God and the
Church Universal, and for the amendment and profit of our land and the
relief of Christians from the damages and burdens which they have borne
on account of the freeholds which the Jews of our realm claim to have in
lands, tenements, fees, rents and other holdings; and that prejudice may
not grow hereafter to us or the commonalty of our realm or to the realm
itself: We have provided by the counsel of the prelates, magnates and
chiefs who are of our council, and also have ordained and decreed for us
and our heirs that no Jew have a freehold in manors, lands, tenements,
fees, rents and holdings whatsoever by charter, gift, feoffment,
confirmation or any other obligation, or in any other wise; so however
that they may dwell hereafter in their houses in which they themselves
dwell in cities, boroughs or other towns, and may have them as they have
been wont to have them in times past; and also that they may lawfully
let to Jews only and not to Christians other their houses, which they
have to let; so, however, that it be not lawful for our Jews of London
to buy or in any other wise purchase<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> more houses than they now have
in our city of London, whereby the parish churches of the same city or
the rectors of the same may incur loss. Nevertheless the same Jews of
London shall be able to repair their ancient houses and buildings
formerly demolished and destroyed, and restore them at their will to
their former condition. We have also provided and decreed by the same
our council that touching their houses aforesaid to be dwelt in or let,
as is aforesaid, no Jew plead or be able to plead by our original writs
of Chancery but only before our justices appointed to the guardianship
of the Jews by the writs of Jewry hitherto used and accustomed. Touching
lands and holdings, however, whereof Jews were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> enfeoffed before the
present Statute, which also they now hold, we will that such
infeudations and gifts be totally annulled, and that the lands and
tenements remain to the Christians who demised the same to them; so,
however, that the Christians satisfy the Jews of the money or chattel
specified in their charters and chirographs,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> which the Jews gave to
the Christians for such gift or infeudation, without interest; with this
condition added, that if those Christians cannot satisfy them thereof
forthwith, it be lawful for the Jews aforesaid to demise those tenements
to other Christians, until their chattels can be levied therefrom
without interest by reasonable extent, according to the true value of
the same, saving, however, to the Christians their lodging, so that the
Jew receive therefrom his money or chattel by the hands of Christians
and not of Jews, as is aforesaid. And if it happen that any Jew
hereafter receive feoffment from any Christian of any fee or tenement
against the present Statute, the Jew shall altogether lose the said
tenement or fee, and the same shall be taken into our hand and kept
safely, and those Christians or their heirs shall have again that land
or tenement from our hand; so, however, that they then pay to us the
whole sum of money which they received from the Jews for such feoffment;
or if their means are not sufficient therefor, then they shall render to
us and our heirs at our Exchequer yearly the true value of those
tenements or fees, by true and reasonable extent of the same, until we
be fully satisfied of such money or chattel.</p>

<p>Moreover touching nurses of young children, bakers, brewers, and cooks
employed by Jews, because Jews and Christians are diverse in faith, we
have provided and decreed that no Christian man or woman presume to
minister to them in the aforesaid services.</p>

<p>And because Jews have long been wont to receive by the hands of
Christians certain rents of lands and tenements of Christians as in
perpetuity, which rents were also called fees, we will and have decreed
that the Statute made of late by us thereon remain in full force, and be
not impaired in any wise by the present Statute.</p>

<p>And therefore we command, straitly enjoining on you, that you cause the
Provision, Ordinance and Statute aforesaid to be publicly proclaimed
throughout your whole bailiwick, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> to be straitly kept and observed.
In witness whereof, etc. Witness the King at Westminster, July 25.</p>

England.</p>

words:&mdash;Whereas by our letters patent we have granted to our dearest
mother, Eleanor, Queen of England, that no Jew shall dwell or stay in
any towns which she holds in dower by assignment of the lord King Henry,
our father, and of ourself, within our realm, so long as the same towns
be in her hand; and for this cause we have provided that the Jews of
Marlborough be transferred to our town of Devizes, the Jews of
Gloucester to our town of Bristol, the Jews of Worcester to our town of
Hereford, and the Jews of Cambridge to our city of Norwich, with their
Chirograph Chests, and with all their goods, and that henceforth they
dwell and stay in the aforesaid towns and city among the rest of our
Jews there: We command you that you cause the aforesaid Jews of
Marlborough, Gloucester, Worcester and Cambridge to be removed from
those towns, without doing any damage to them in respect of their
persons or their goods, and to transfer themselves to the places
aforesaid with their Chirograph Chests, as safely to our use as you
shall think it may be done. Witness myself at Clarendon on the 16th day

Whereas formerly in our Parliament at Westminster on the quinzaine of
St. Michael in the third year of our reign, to the honour of God and the
profit of the people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> of our realm, we ordained and decreed that no Jew
thenceforth should lend anything at usury to any Christian on lands,
rents or other things, but that they should live by their commerce and
labour; and the same Jews, afterwards maliciously deliberating among
themselves, contriving a worse sort of usury which they called courtesy
(<i>curialitatem</i>), have depressed our people aforesaid on all sides under
colour thereof, the last offence doubling the first; whereby, for their
crimes and to the honour of the Crucified, we have caused those Jews to
go forth from our realm as traitors: We, wishing to swerve not from our
former choice, but rather to follow it, do make totally null and void
all manner of penalties and usuries and every sort thereof, which could
be demanded by actions by reason of the Jewry from any Christians of our
realm for any times whatsoever; wishing that nothing be in any wise
demanded from the Christians aforesaid by reason of the debts aforesaid,
save only the principal sums which they received from the Jews
aforesaid; the amount of which debts we will that the Christians
aforesaid verify before you by the oath of three good and lawful men by
whom the truth of the matter may the better be known, and thereafter pay
the same to us at terms convenient to them to be fixed by you. And
therefore we command you that you cause our said grace so piously
granted to be read in the aforesaid Exchequer, and to be enrolled on the
rolls of the same Exchequer, and to be straitly kept, according to the

<p>The attempt to find an inclusive definition of the manor, true alike for
every century and for all parts of the country, involves a risk of
divorcing the institution from its historical associations, and of
depriving it of its social and economic significance. The typical manor
exists only in theory, actual manors being continuously modified by the
inevitable changes due to the growth of population and commercial
expansion. Such modifications of economic structure proceeded with great
rapidity between the Conquest and the beginning of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> fourteenth
century. A comparison of the neat simplicity of the royal manor of
Havering in Domesday Book (Section I., No. 10) with its highly complex
organisation in the time of Edward I. (below, No. 1), reveals an
extraordinary development; the 10 hides, 40 villeins and 40 ploughs of
the one are represented by the 40 virgates of the other, but the
elaborate hierarchy of tenants in the later survey throws into strange
relief the primitive customary nucleus and gives it the appearance
already of an archaic survival. It is reasonable to assume that the
generation which immediately followed the Conquest witnessed a
crystallisation of custom, which preserved untouched for centuries the
lord's demesne and the common fields; while on the other hand the
colonisation of the waste by progressive enclosures slowly altered the
social balance, emphasising the disabilities of the villein class and
widening the gulf between lord and customary tenant. The economic
position of the customary tenants was becoming worse by the operation of
natural laws, for not only was the subdivision of the virgates reaching
its limits, but common rights were being continuously diminished by
enclosure. Large numbers of the Havering virgaters in 1307 were
occupying quite small holdings, while the purprestures, or encroachments
on the waste, were becoming formidable. These considerations suggest
that early manorial history can best be studied by investigations into
the extent of enclosure in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and
that concentration on the unprogressive nucleus of the manor, on
villeinage and customary tenure, may well blind the student to the
greater economic significance of the developments outside the common
fields. It thus appears probable that the visitation of the Black Death
will fall into place as an incident rather than an epoch.</p>

<p>The documents given below attempt to illustrate manorial history in both
its praedial and its personal aspects. The essential features of the
manor, in its legal aspect, namely, the customary court, customary
tenure, and customary services, are shown in the Extent (No. 1) and the
extracts from a Court Roll (No. 2), while the common-field system and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the distribution of strips appear in Nos. 3 and 4. The commutation of
service for rent (Nos. 1, 8, 9) and the transition from customary to
leasehold tenure (Nos. 7, 10) show natural forces at work undermining
the traditional economy; while the leasing of customary holdings (No. 7)
or of a whole manor to all the tenants in common (No. 5) or to a farmer
(No. 10), the grant of manors to the tenants at fee farm in perpetuity
(No. 6), and the enclosure of waste (Nos. 1, 11, 12, 13), illustrate the
wide range of variety possible in the actual management of the
agricultural unit. There appears to be little doubt that the villeins
suffered a considerable depression as the result of the Norman Conquest;
their refusal, however, to acquiesce permanently in the changed
conditions is clear from their continued efforts to rise out of their
disabilities and to improve their social and economic status, a movement
which begins by the attempts of individuals to climb in the scale by
flight (No. 2), by claims to be on the king's ancient demesne (Nos. 14,
15), and by the bringing of actions before the justices of assize, a
procedure open only to freemen (Nos. 17-22), and gathers force in the
fourteenth century until it culminates in the "great fellowship" which
organised a self-conscious class revolt throughout the country (No. 29).
No. 16 is an instance of the little writ of right, one of the privileges
of the favoured tenants on ancient demesne. Manumission was always a
possible method of achieving freedom (No. 23), and it may be that the
grant of a bondman (No. 24) was a stage in the process of emancipation.
Manumission became common at a time when the demand for English wool was
encouraging pasture at the sacrifice of tillage, but even in the
fifteenth century men might suffer atrocious ignominy through the
imputation of villeinage (Nos. 25, 26). The dislocation caused by the
Black Death is dramatically illustrated in the Court-Roll (No. 2), the
letter from the abbot of Selby (No. 27), and the accounts of the South
Frith iron-works in the year before and the year after the first
visitation (No. 28); it is to be noted, in the latter document, that for
the years 1347-8 and 1348-9 there are no accounts extant at all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>The Manor of Havering extended by the order of the King before ... and
Richard le Rus in the thirty-fifth year of the reign by Richard of the
Elms (<i>de Ulmis</i>)<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>....</p>

<p>Who say on their oath that the King has there in demesne 223&frac12; acres
of arable land, whereof the acre is worth 6<i>d.</i> a year.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 35em;">Sum, 111<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Further, 38 acres of arable land, which Adam de Rumford holds, which are
of the demesne and were arrented by William Brito and his fellows, as is
found below.</p>

<p>Further, 5 acres of arable land, which Walter le Blake holds, and they
are of the demesne and were arrented by the same as below, etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Further, 15 acres of meadow, whereof each is worth 16<i>d.</i> a year.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 35em;">Sum, 20<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Further, 4 acres of meadow, which Baldwin le Blund holds, which are of
the demesne and were arrented by the same as below, etc.</p>

<p>Further, 23 acres of several pasture, whereof each is worth 14&frac14;<i>d.</i> a
year.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 35em;">Sum, 27<i>s.</i> 3&frac34;<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Further, they say that the King can have in the common pasture, to wit,
in the woods, heaths and marshes, his oxen and cows, sheep, horses and
swine and other his beasts at his will, and so that all the tenants of
the same manor may have their beasts and all their cattle in the
aforesaid common when they will. And if the King have no beasts in the
common, he shall take nothing therefor.</p>

<p>Further, they say that the King has a plot of land in his park enclosed
with hedge and dyke, which is called the King's garden; but it is not
tilled; therefore there is no profit.</p>

<p>Further, they say that the King has there his park enclosed round with a
paling, and as well the men of the same manor as others of the
neighbourhood outside the manor ought to renew and repair that paling as
often as need be,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> according as is found below; and in that park no
cattle nor any beasts ought to enter except by licence of the King's
bailiff. And if any cattle or any beasts enter the same park without
licence of the bailiff, they are forfeit and must be ransomed at the
will of the bailiff, if they are foreign, and if they are of the manor,
then they are to be ransomed for 1<i>d.</i> for each foot, if it please the
bailiff to take so much.</p>

<p>Further, they say that the King has in the same manor three foreign
woods pertaining to the aforesaid manor, which the King's bailiffs of
the same manor have always had in keeping, together with the aforesaid
manor, and they have had attachments and all other esplees<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> of the
same woods, to complete the farm of the same manor, to wit, Westwode,
Haraldeswode and Crocleph. And in those three woods all the tenants of
the same manor ought to have common of herbage for all their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> beasts and
all their cattle throughout the whole year, except between the feast of
Michaelmas and the feast of Martinmas,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and then also there may enter
into the same woods the horses of the aforesaid tenants, as also
throughout the whole year, and the swine of the same tenants for
pannage,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and no other beasts. And if sheep or oxen be found in the
aforesaid woods, or geese, except when driven to the water or the market
or elsewhere, so that they make no stay in the same, whosesoever they
be, they ought to be imparked and kept until they shall have satisfied
the King's bailiff for that trespass. And if within the aforesaid time
any foreign beast, which does not belong to any tenant of the manor, be
found in the aforesaid woods, the King's bailiff can ransom it, to wit,
for 40<i>d.</i> for each ox or cow, or 1<i>d.</i> for each foot of each beast, or
otherwise, as he shall please, within 40<i>d.</i> And if any foreign cart
shall pass through the aforesaid woods within the aforesaid time, it
shall give to the King's bailiff 1<i>d.</i> of custom. And if any foreigner
shall drive his beasts through the aforesaid woods within the aforesaid
time, he shall give to the King's bailiff 1<i>d.</i> of custom. And these
customs are called "leph" within the aforesaid time.</p>

<p>Further, they say that the King's bailiff ought to have all the wood
thrown down by the wind and all windfall wood in the aforesaid three
woods within the aforesaid time, to complete the farm of the manor.</p>

<p>And the pannage of the whole manor and the aforesaid customs called
"leph" and the wood and windfall wood within the aforesaid time are
extended in the profit of the manor at 100<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Further, they say that no men of the foreign neighbourhood ought to have
common in the aforesaid woods at any time of the year, nor ought their
beasts or cattle to enter the aforesaid woods except by licence of the
bailiff. And if they enter, they ought to be imparked and kept until
they shall satisfy the bailiff for that trespass.</p>

<p>Further, they say that every customary cart which carries wood or
charcoal or any other thing of custom for sale and passes through any of
the aforesaid woods shall give to the bailiff 4<i>d.</i> of custom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

to the use of the King in the presence of William Brito and his fellows,

<p>And thus there are in all in the aforesaid manor 40 virgates of land
which render yearly in rent of assize:
Sum, 47<i>l.</i> 19<i>s.</i> 5&frac12;<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Further, from works of the aforesaid 40 virgates 14<i>l.</i> yearly.</p>

<p>And be it known that each virgate ought to do all the works
underwritten, and the works of each virgate are worth by themselves
7<i>s.</i> a year.</p>

<p>Virgate works.&mdash;Further, it is acknowledged by the aforesaid jurors
that each virgate in the aforesaid manor owes all the customs
underwritten, and so in proportion half a virgate and other parts
according to the portion and quantity of land, as the virgate is
divided, to wit, to plough 4 acres a year in the winter season, and the
ploughing of each acre is worth 4<i>d.</i> Further, it ought to harrow those
4 acres, and the harrowing of each acre is worth &frac12;<i>d.</i> Further it
ought to thresh and winnow 1 quarter of rye for seed, and that threshing
and winnowing is worth 2<i>d.</i> Further it ought to reap, bind and cock 4
acres,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> and this custom is worth 3<i>d.</i> for each acre, to wit, of rye.
Further it ought to plough 4 acres in the summer season, and the
ploughing of each acre is worth 3<i>d.</i> Further it ought to harrow those 4
acres, and the harrowing of each acre is worth &frac12;<i>d.</i> Further it ought
to thresh and winnow 1&frac12; quarters of oats, and the threshing and
winnowing is worth 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> Further it ought to reap, bind and cock 4
acres of oats, and that custom is worth 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> for each acre. Further
it ought to find two men for one day to hoe until noon, and that custom
is worth 2<i>d.</i> Further it ought to find two men for one day to hoe in
the summer season until noon, and that custom is worth 2<i>d</i>. Further it
ought to carry the corn from the field of the lord the King to the
grange with one waggon for one day until noon, and that carrying is
worth 3&frac12;<i>d.</i> Further it ought to find four men to lift the hay in the
meadow of the lord the King for one day, and that custom is worth 2<i>d.</i>
Further it ought to carry a waggonload of hay, and each carrying is
worth 3<i>d.</i> Further it ought to manure with manure of the lord the King
4 selions<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> 40 perches in length in the next field ploughed for
fallow, and that manuring is worth 4<i>d.</i> And it ought to do all these
customs beforewritten at its own cost.</p>

<p>Sum of the aforesaid works, 6<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> And of lawful increment for each
virgate, 10<i>d.</i> a year. And thus the sum of the works of each virgate is
7<i>s.</i> a year.</p>

<p>Further, each virgate ought to enclose 6 perches of the paling of the
park of the lord the King in the same manor with timber given by livery
of the foresters and parkers. Further, all the tenants in the said manor
ought to pay pannage for all the swine which they have between the feast
of St. Michael<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and the feast of St. Martin,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> except those whom
the King's charter protects, wheresoever they be within the manor, to
wit, they owe a tenth part of the value of each pig which is worth more
than 5<i>d.</i>, whether there be acorns (<i>pesona</i>) or not; so nevertheless
that for a pig worth more than 20<i>d.</i> the tenant shall give only 2<i>d.</i>
Further all the tenants and sub-tenants throughout the bounds ought to
guard the prisoners of the lord the King by night, except the cotmen,
who ought to guard the said prisoners by day; and the prisoners ought to
be imprisoned at the houses of the cotmen by night and day from house to
house until their term be finished.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

they have lost the habit of returning, they begin to be runaways, after

<p>To all Christ's faithful who shall see or hear the present writing,
William, by the grace of God Abbot of Ramsey, greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>Know ye that we have demised at farm to our men of Hemingford our manor
of Hemingford from Michaelmas in the eighth year of the reign of King
Edward, son of King Henry, at the beginning of the ninth, until the end
of seven years next following, for 40<i>l.</i> sterling to be paid to us
therefrom yearly at the four terms, to wit, at Michaelmas 10<i>l.</i>, on St.
Andrew's Day<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> 10<i>l.</i>, at the Annunciation<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> 10<i>l.</i> and at

<p>Our aforesaid men shall hold the aforesaid manor with all its

<p>Also they shall have all profits of the town except our tallages,

reeve of Ramsey.</p>

<p>And be it known that if any customary tenant die without heir of his
body, we will demise his land and his messuage to whomsoever we will and
keep in our hand the gersum<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> arising thence.</p>

<p>Also no customary tenant shall make fine for relieving or marrying his
daughters without our presence, but their gersums shall be made before
us in the presence of the reeves or any of the farmers, who shall have
and collect the said money towards their farm.</p>

<p>Nor may the said farmers demise house or land to any stranger or one of
another's homage, without our special licence.</p>

<p>For we will that such gersums beyond the fixed farm be entirely paid to
us.</p>

<p>Moreover the said farmers have received the following stock:&mdash;</p>

<p>The corn grange full of corn on either side the door by the door posts
and by the beams beyond the door, and so sloping to the roof of the

except in the last year, in which they shall have a serjeant, by whose

which John late earl of Cornwall, our brother, now deceased, made in
these words:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>John, son of the illustrious King of England, earl of Cornwall, to all
and singular who shall see or hear the present writing indented,
greeting in the Lord. Know ye that, having regard to the no small
decrease and decay of rents and farms pertaining to our manor of Kirton
in Lindsey in times past, for that tenants of escheated tenements in the
same manor, having no estate of the same tenements save from year to
year or at least at the will of the lords, our predecessors there, have
made no outlay or the least which they could on the maintenance of the
buildings on the same tenements; and wishing to raise again the
aforesaid rents and farms as much as we can for our advantage; we have
granted for us and our heirs and by our present writing have demised to
John of Westminster and Emma his wife and Thomas, son of the same John
and Emma, those two parts of all those tenements with the appurtenances
in the town of Kirton aforesaid which the same John before the making of
this writing held of us during our pleasure, as of an escheat formerly
in our hand of the tenements which were sometime of Thomas of Bromholm;
to have and to hold to the same John and Emma his wife and Thomas, son
of the same John and Emma, and each of them that lives the longer, for
their whole life, of us and our heirs, rendering therefrom yearly to us
and our heirs 100<i>s.</i> sterling at the feasts of Easter and Michaelmas by

the aforesaid two parts of the tenements aforesaid with their
appurtenances to the aforesaid John and Emma his wife and Thomas, son of
the same John and Emma, for their whole life, as is aforesaid, against
all people for the aforesaid rent. In witness whereof we have thought
fit to set our seal to this writing. These witnesses:&mdash;Sirs John de

<p>To the most reverend father in God, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
Chancellor of England.</p>

<p>Beseecheth lowly your poor bedefolks, Elizabeth Baroun, Harry Baroun and
Richard Baroun, which be the King's tenants, that whereas the said
Elizabeth was possessed and seised of a messuage and 4 acres of land in
the town of Great Hormead in the shire of Hertford, and the said
messuage and land held to her and to her heirs at the will of my lord of
Oxford as of his manor of Hormead in the same shire by copy of court
roll after the custom of the said manor, there hath one Harry Edmond,
farmer of the said manor, without cause reasonable and contrary to the
custom of the said manor, entered in the said messuage and land and put
out the said Elizabeth, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> certain goods and chattels of the said
Elizabeth, Harry and Richard, to the value of 40 marks in the said house
being, seized, and it withholdeth, and over that the said Harry Edmond
with his adherents daily lie in wait to beat and slay the said Harry and
Richard, your beseechers, so that they dare not well abide in their
houses neither go about their husbandry, to their uttermost destruction
and undoing for ever, without succour of your gracious lordship: Please
your good grace to consider the premises and that your said beseechers
have no remedy at the Common Law, to grant a writ directed to the said
Harry Edmond, commanding him to appear before you at a certain day upon
a certain pain by you to be limited, to be examined of the premises, and
thereupon to do that good faith and conscience require, and that for the
love of God and in way of charity.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This is the answer of Harry Edmond to the bill of Elizabeth Baron, Harry
Baron and Richard Baron, in the Chancery.</p>

<p>First, whereas it is surmised by the said Elizabeth that she was
possessed and seised of a messuage and four acres of land in the town of
Great Hormead in the shire of Hertford, and the said messuage and land
held to her and to her heirs at the will of my lord of Oxford as of his
manor of Hormead in the same shire by copy of court roll after the
custom of the said manor, and that the said Harry Edmond, farmer of the
same manor, without cause reasonable and contrary to the custom of the
said manor, entered into the said messuage and land and put out the said
Elizabeth: The said Harry saith that the said messuage and land be
holden of my said lord of Oxford bondly at the will of my said lord as
of his said manor by the services of three shillings and halfpenny of
yearly rent and by a certain service called the common fine, as it
falleth more or less after the entries and ... of the tenants of the
said manor by the custom of the said manor, by cause whereof the said
Harry with one Thomas Denys, under-steward of the court of the said
manor, by the commandment of my said lord of Oxford entered into the
said messuage and land, after which entry my said lord let the said
messuage and land to the said Harry for term of years, by virtue of
which lease he [entered] the said messuage and land, as lawful is for
him, which matter the said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> Harry is ready to prove as this Court will
[award], and prayeth as for that to be dismissed out of this Court.</p>

<p>[And as for t]he seizing and withholding of certain goods and chattels
of the said Elizabeth, Harry Baron and Richard, to the value of [40
marks, as is sur]mised by the said bill, the said Harry Edmond saith
that the seizing and withholding of the said goods and chattels is a
matter determinable at the Common Law, and not in this Court of the
Chancery. Wherefore as for that he prayeth to be dismissed out of this
Court.</p>

<p>And as for the declaration of the said Harry as for the said goods and
chattels, the said Harry saith that he never seized nor withheld the
said goods and chattels neither no parcel thereof, as it is surmised by
the said bill, which matter the said Harry Edmond is ready to prove as
the Court will award, if the Court rule him thereto.</p>

<p>And as for the lying in await surmised by the said bill the said Harry
Edmond saith that the said lying in await is matter determinable by the
Common Law and not in this Court of the Chancery, wherefore as for that
matter he prayeth to be dismissed out of this Court of the Chancery.
But, for the declaration of the said Harry Edmond in that matter, the
said Harry Edmond saith that he never lay in await neither to beat nor
to slay the said Harry Baron nor the said Richard, as they surmise by
their said bill, which matter the said Harry Edmond is ready to prove as
this Court will award, if the said Court will rule him thereto.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_136_136" id="Footnote_136_136"></a><a href="#FNanchor_136_136"><span class="label">[136]</span></a> This case illustrates first, the protection coming to be
given by Chancery to villein or customary tenure, and second, the
growing desire of lords to substitute leasehold for copyhold, a process
which began at least as early as the beginning of the fourteenth
century; see No. 7 above, and Part II., Section I.; <i>cf.</i> also Savine,
in E.H.R. xvii., 296.</p></div>

<p>Also, because many great men of England, who have enfeoffed their
knights and freeholders of small tenements in their great manors, have
complained that they cannot make their profit of the residue of their
manors, as of wastes, woods, and pastures, though the same feoffees have
sufficient pasture, as much as belongs to their tenements: it is thus
provided and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> granted, that when any persons so enfeoffed bring an
assize of novel disseisin touching their common of pasture, and it is
acknowledged before the justices that they have as much pasture as
suffices for their tenements, and that they have free entry and issue
from their tenements into their pasture, then they shall be content
therewith; and they of whom they had complained shall go quit of the
profit which they have made of the lands, wastes, woods, and pastures;
and if they allege that they have not sufficient pasture, or sufficient
entry and issue as belongs to their tenements, then the truth shall be
inquired by assize; and if it be acknowledged by the assize that their
entry or issue is in any way hindered by the same [deforcers] or that
they have not sufficient pasture and sufficient entry and issue, as is
aforesaid, then shall they recover their seisin by view of the jurors:
so that by their discretion and oath, the plaintiffs shall have
sufficient pasture and sufficient entry and issue in form aforesaid, and
the disseisors shall be in the mercy of the lord the King, and shall
yield damages, as they ought to have rendered before this provision. And
if it be acknowledged by the assize that the plaintiffs have sufficient
pasture with free and sufficient entry and issue, as is aforesaid, then
the others may make their profit lawfully of the residue, and go quit of
that assize.</p>

<p>The assize comes to recognise if Elias of Leyburn unjustly etc.
disseised Wymar of Leyburn of common of his pasture pertaining to his
free tenement in the same town of Leyburn after, etc.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>And Elias comes and says that an assize ought not to be made thereof
because that pasture belonged to five lords, and a covenant was made
between the lords that each should make his profit of his part, and by
this covenant he caused his part to be tilled, and thereof he put
himself on a jury.</p>

<p>The jurors say that the wood was at one time common, in such wise that
there were five sharers who had the wood common, and afterwards by their
consent a partition was made between them that each should have his part
in severalty, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> it was granted that each might assart<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> his part
and grow corn, saving however to each of them common of herbage after
the corn was carried, and most of them assarted their part, but the wood
whereof complaint is made was not then assarted, and because he to whom
the wood pertains has now assarted a part, the said Wymar has brought a
writ of <i>novel disseisin</i>. But because it is acknowledged that the wood
was thus partitioned among the sharers, it is decided that the aforesaid
Elias has not disseised him, and so Elias is dismissed <i>sine die</i> and
Wymar is in mercy. And it shall be lawful for each sharer to assart his
wood, saving to each of them common of his pasture after the corn and
hay is carried.</p>

Robert caused to be enclosed a meadow lying near his land, in which he
ought to have common of herbage after hay-carrying, and that it ought to
lie to pasture every third year with the fallow, wherefore he says that
the dyke is to his injury and puts himself on a jury thereof. And Robert
does the like.</p>

<p>The jurors say that the aforesaid Adam always used to have common in
that meadow and in the land of Robert by that meadow after the corn and
hay were carried, and when the land lay fallow, then in both meadow and
fallow, and Robert caused the meadow to be enclosed so that Adam can
have no entry to that pasture. And so it is awarded that the dyke be
thrown down, and the meadow made as it should be, so that the aforesaid
Adam have entry and issue, and that Robert be in mercy, etc.</p>

<p>The assize comes to recognise if Bartholomew son of Eustace unjustly and
without a judgment disseised William son of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> Henry of his free tenement
in Pilton after the last, etc. And Bartholomew comes and says that the
assize ought not to be made thereof because the said William held the
tenement only in villeinage, and is his villein, and does for him all
customs such as ploughings and others, and says further that he cannot
marry his daughter save by his lord's licence etc.</p>

<p>And William son of Henry comes and says that he is a free man and that
he holds his tenement freely and that at another time he impleaded in
the court of the lord the King as a free man touching the aforesaid
tenement, to wit, touching the services and the like, and thereof he
brings the rolls of Sir Martin de Patteshull to warrant and likewise a
writ which the same Martin wrote with his own hand, which also was sent
to the sheriff of Rutland for the same plea, and the sheriff's clerk has
shown him the writ, etc. A day is given to hear his judgment on such a
day, etc.</p>

<p>On the day the court records at Westminster that the same William in the
time of King John was convicted at Bedford of owing villein customs from
that tenement, such as ploughing, reaping and many others at his own
food, and of being unable to marry his daughter or sister without
licence of his lord. And so it is decided that the assize of <i>novel
disseisin</i> does not lie because the tenement is not free, and so William
is in mercy. And if he will, let him plead in the manor by writ of
right.</p>

<p>The men of the Prior and convent of St. Swithin of Crondall, Hurstbourne
and Whitchurch, complained to the lord the King that whereas they had
been granted to the same Prior and convent and their church in pure and
perpetual alms by the ancestors of the lord the King, the Prior and
convent demanded of them other customs and services than they used to do
in the times in which they were in the hands of the aforesaid
predecessors, etc.</p>

<p>And Oliver the Steward and Horder come and say that they demand no other
services than the men used and ought to do, and that the lands were
never in the hands of the ancestors of the lord the King, because two
hundred years before the conquest of England they were given to the
Prior and Convent of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> St. Swithin and by others than Kings, to wit,
earls and others, etc., and then they owed and used to do whatever was
commanded them. But in process of time, when the priory was well nigh
destroyed by one Abbot Robert,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> bishop Richard came and for the
profit of the Prior and convent disposed of their lands and manors in
such wise that he caused an inventory to be made of the holdings and of
the names of the tenants and their services, as well tenants in
villeinage as in frank fee, and so that he demanded no other services
than they did then and were then set forth in the inventory. Afterwards
however when the lands were in the hand of farmers at one time and at
one time in the hand of the aforesaid villeins for forty years,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> the
farmers remitted to them certain services and customs for money. And
when the lands were in the hand of the aforesaid villeins they detained
and withheld the rent to the sum of 60<i>s.</i> and more, and also a great
amount of corn, and withheld a great amount of the lands contrary to the
aforesaid enrolment made by the aforesaid bishop Richard. And because
the aforesaid men acknowledge that they are villeins, as is aforesaid,
and because they cannot deny these things, they are told to do to the
Prior and convent the services and customs which they used to do. And
the lord the King will not meddle with them since they were never in the
hand of him or his ancestors, etc.</p>

according to the custom of the manor of Havering atte Bower you do

touching 40<i>s.</i> of rent with the appurtenances in Havering atte Bower,

<p>A jury comes by consent of the parties [to recognise] whether William
son of Henry and his ancestors held two parts of a bovate of land with
the appurtenances in Pilton in villeinage of the ancestors of
Bartholomew son of Eustace, doing these underwritten customs, to wit,
3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a year of farm, and at Christmas 4 hens, and at the summons
of Bartholomew, between Christmas and the Purification, one feast, and
whether in Lent he ought to plough for one day at his own food, and to
harrow for one day at his own food, and on Easter day to give 20 eggs,
and in summer to plough for one day at the dinner of Bartholomew,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
to reap for one day at the food of Bartholomew, to wit, twice a day, and
for one day to carry his hay at the food of the same Bartholomew, and in
autumn to do boon-work for Bartholomew, with his whole household except
his wife, and for Bartholomew's loveboon to find a man at his own food,
and in winter to plough for one day at Bartholomew's dinner, and
whether, if he wish to marry his daughter or his sister, he shall make
fine with Bartholomew as best he may; or whether William or his
ancestors have held the land freely, rendering 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a year and
doing foreign service for all service, etc.</p>

<p>The jurors say that the same William and his ancestors used and ought to
do all the aforesaid customs which Bartholomew demands, to wit, from 1
bovate of land with the appurtenances, except that on Christmas day when
he renders hens he ought to eat with Bartholomew on the same day, and
furthermore that they never saw him sell a daughter or sister or give
merchet or marry, but have seen that Bartholomew sold to Ralph Cayllard
John, brother of William by the same father and mother, for 40<i>s.</i>, and
the same Ralph did with him his will.</p>

<p>And so it is awarded that William is convicted of villeinage, and if he
will do the aforesaid customs, let him hold the bovate of land by the
same customs, but if not, let Bartholomew do his will with the land and
with William as with his villein, and let him be delivered to him.</p>

<p>The assize comes to recognise if Thomas de Sumerdeby and many others
disseised Roger Gladewine of his free tenement in Spitelgate after
etc.,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> whereof he complains that they disseised him of 2&frac12; acres

and the tenement whereof view is made is villeinage, and thereof they
put themselves on a jury. And Roger says that he is a free man and the
tenement is free, and that his ancestors were free men and held freely,
and thereof he puts himself on a jury.</p>

<p>The jurors say that the aforesaid Roger holds his tenement in the same
town by 2<i>s.</i> a year and by two works in autumn at his lord's food, and
he shall give two hens at Christmas and eat with his lord. And
questioned if he or any of his ancestors had given merchet for marrying
his daughter, they say, No. Questioned if he had ever been tallaged,
they say, No. And the aforesaid Thomas, questioned if others of his fee
do other villein services, he says that others do all manner of villein
services. And because he does no service save the aforesaid money
payment and the services named, nor gives merchet for a daughter, nor is
tallaged, therefore it is awarded that he held freely and that he
recover his seisin, and Thomas and the others are in mercy.</p>

<p>Hamelin son of Ralph was attached to answer Hugh de Gundevill wherefore
he brought an assize of <i>novel disseisin</i> against the aforesaid Hugh,
his lord, touching a tenement in Pinpre, inasmuch as he is a villein and
acknowledged himself to be the villein of the aforesaid Hugh's father in
the time of the lord King John, etc. before the justices in eyre at
Sherborne, as the same Hugh says, and thereon shows that Simon de
Patteshull, Eustace de Faucumberge and others their fellows were then
justices. And that Thomas acknowledged himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> to be his father's
villein, as is aforesaid, he puts himself on the record of the court and
on the rolls, etc.</p>

<p>And Hamelin comes and denies that he is a villein or ever acknowledged
himself to be a villein in the court of the lord the King, as Hugh says,
and thereof puts himself in like manner on the record of the court. But
he will speak the truth. He says that at that time, to wit, in the eyre
of the justices, he held certain land in villeinage which he had bought,
and then acknowledged that the land was villeinage, and specifically
denies that he ever acknowledged himself to be a villein. The rolls of
the eyre are searched, and there it is recorded that one Osbert Crede
brought an assize of <i>mort d'ancestor</i> in respect of the death of Henry
his brother against Hamelin touching a carucate of land with the
appurtenances in Pinpre, in such wise that Hamelin answered against the
assize that it ought not to proceed because he could not gain or lose
that land, because he was the villein of Hugh de Gundevill, father of
the aforesaid Hugh. And this was found in many rolls, and when Hamelin
should have had his judgment, he absented himself and withdrew without
licence, whereupon the sheriff was ordered to have his body on such a
day, etc., to hear his judgment thereof, etc. And on that day he came
not, and the sheriff reported that he had withdrawn himself and could
not be found, wherefore the sheriff was ordered to take the whole of
Hamelin's land into the hand of the lord the King, and to keep it
safely, etc., because Hamelin withdrew himself and would not stand to
right touching Hugh's complaint of him, and to certify the justices of
what he should do thereof on such a day etc. On that day Hamelin came
not and the sheriff reported that he had taken his land into the hand of
the lord the King.</p>

<p>And because the court records that Hamelin acknowledged himself to be a
villein, and Hugh afterwards by the aforesaid assize of <i>novel
disseisin</i> lost his land, it is decided that Hugh recover seisin of that
land whereon the assize was taken, and that he have Hamelin as his
villein convicted, and that the assize of <i>novel disseisin</i> which was
taken thereof be held void, and that Hugh be quit of the mercy wherein
he was put for that disseisin. And the sheriff is ordered to make
diligent enquiry who were the jurors of that assize and to have them on
such a day, etc., to hear the judgment on them for the oath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> which they
made thereof. And if Hamelin held any tenement of Hugh, let Hugh do
therewith as with his own, etc.</p>

<p>The justices in eyre in the county of Essex were ordered to take a grand
assize between Thomas of Woodford, claimant, and John de la Hille,
tenant, of a virgate and a half of land with the appurtenances in
Woodford. And the said John and Thomas came before the justices at
Chelmsford and offered themselves, and the bailiff of the Abbot of
Waltham came and said both claimant and tenant were villeins, and the
tenement was the Abbot's villeinage and therefore the assize thereof
ought not to proceed. He was questioned by the tenant whether the latter
was a villein or not, and he said Yes, asserting that the said tenement
was the Abbot's villeinage.</p>

<p>And Thomas comes [and says] that this ought not to hurt him, because
when he impleaded the aforesaid John in the court of the lord Abbot by
writ of the lord the King, no mention was made by the Abbot nor by John
that the tenement was villeinage nor that John was a villein, but
because the Abbot failed to do him right in his court, Thomas went to
the county court and complained in the county court that the lord Abbot
had failed to do him right in his court, and the Abbot, summoned hereon,
came not, and the suit proceeded so far in the county court that the
tenant asked and obtained view of the land. Afterwards he put himself on
a grand assize as to which of the two had greater right in the aforesaid
land without any challenge of villeinage being made on the part of the
Abbot or of John. And this he sought to be allowed him.</p>

<p>And the Abbot's bailiff comes and denies the whole, as the court of the
lord the King should award. And he said that unknown to the Abbot and
without his court failing to do Thomas right, the suit was taken away to
the county court, and this he asked to be allowed him. And owing to the
doubt a day was given to the parties at Westminster, etc. And because
the Abbot permitted John to be impleaded in his court first and in the
county court afterwards until he put himself on a grand assize, the
Abbot not having lodged the claim which he should have made, it is
awarded that the assize proceed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>William de Bissopestun, William de Ludington and Geoffrey de
Cherlescote, knights, whom the lord the King appointed as justices to
take an assize of <i>novel disseisin</i> which Thomas son of Adam arraigned
against Ralph, Prior of Stiffleppe, and many others, of a tenement in
Aldrestun, [were summoned] to make a record of that assize before the
justices at Westminster, and to certify the same justices how far the
process in the same assize was carried, and the same Thomas was summoned
to hear that record. And William and Geoffrey come and record that the
assize came to recognise before them if the aforesaid Prior and Thomas
son of Payn and Gilbert son of Henry [and] Osmar le Bracur unjustly and
without a judgment and after the last, etc., disseised the aforesaid
Thomas son of Adam of his free tenement in Aldredestun. And the Prior
came before them, and, being asked if he wished to say anything against
the assize, said that the assize ought not to be made thereof, because
the same tenement was his villeinage, and the same Thomas was his
villein and owed villein customs as did all others of the aforesaid
manor, such as ploughings and reapings, and he could not marry his
daughter as a freeman could.</p>

<p>And Thomas acknowledged that he owed certain customs at the Prior's
food, and that he owed him a rent and a fixed fine for his daughter, and
said that he was a free man and held freely of the Prior, and thereof
put himself on a jury. And hereon a jury was taken and the jurors said
that they (the aforesaid Prior and others) disseised him of his free
tenement, and after the term,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> and the damage was taxed and
estimated at two marks.</p>

<p>And the Prior says that in part their record is correct, but they say
too little, because the jurors said that Thomas ought to give 12<i>d.</i> for
marrying his daughter, and owed many other customs; and he and his
fellows sought respite that they might have the opinion of Sir Robert de
Lexinton whether this was a free tenement from which they know what the
tenant ought to do and what not; and they could have no respite.</p>

<p>And the justices deny all this, and say that the jurors said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> nothing of
the 12<i>d.</i><a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> And so it was awarded that the justices made a right

and tenements of the same John, to wit, 60 messuages, 6 tofts, one
dovecote, 600 acres of land, 30 acres of meadow, 6 acres of pasture and
6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> of rent with the appurtenances in the city of Salisbury,

Burchalk, Bulbridge, Ugford St. James, Wilton, Foulston, Barford St.

his hands, and certain goods and chattels of the same John being at
Wilton in the said county of Wilts likewise to be taken into his hands,
and the same John to be brought to the same late duke's castle of
Pembroke in Wales, where the same late duke imprisoned the same John and
detained him there in prisons so dire, in a dungeon so obscure and dark,
in such great hunger, misery of life, deprivation of food and clothes,
and imposition on the same John of imprisonment, duress and divers other
hardships and miseries, putting aside and abandoning all pity, for seven
years and more, that the same John by occasion thereof has totally lost
the sight of his eyes, miserably incurring bodily blindness for the term
of his life and other incurable infirmities, as we have learned; which
messuages, tofts, dovecote, land, meadow, pasture and rent, by and after
the death of the aforesaid late duke, have descended to us as kinsman
and heir of the same late duke: And now we, being credibly informed upon
the truth of the matter in this behalf, have learned from trustworthy
testimony that the aforesaid John has always been and is a freeman and
of free condition, never infected with the taint of villeinage, and that
all the premises, done and brought upon him so enormously and
opprobriously as well in his person as in his tenements and goods and

<i>temp.</i> Henry IV-Henry VI.</p>

<p>To the most reverend father in God, the archbishop of Canterbury, and
chancellor of England.</p>

<p>Beseecheth meekly your poor bedeman, John Bishop, that where he late was
in his house at Hamble-en-le-Rice in the county of Southampton the 12th
day of March last past in God's peace and the King's, there came John
Wayte, Richard Newport and John Newport with thirteen other persons in
their company arrayed in manner of war, and in full riotous wise in
forcible manner there and then entered the house of your said beseecher
about midnight, and him lying in his bed took, seized and imprisoned,
and his purse with 25<i>s.</i> of money therein and the keys of his coffers
from him took and the same coffers opened and 28<i>l.</i> of his money, 2
standing cups of silver gilt, 7 flat pieces of silver, 2 masers, 6
girdles and a baselard harnessed with silver, of the goods and chattels
of William Poleyn of the value of 40<i>l.</i> there being in the keeping of
your said beseecher, and 5 pieces of kerseys and the stuff of household
of your said beseecher to the value of 30<i>l.</i> there found, took and bare
away, and him from thence the same night to Sydyngworth led and in
horrible strait prison kept by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> space of two days, and from thence
him carried to a place called Spereshot's place in the same [town] and
him there in full strait grievous prison in stocks kept still by the
space of five days and other full great wrongs to him did against the
peace of the King our sovereign lord to the utter destruction of the
body of your said beseecher, which is not of power to sue his remedy by
the common law, and importable loss of his goods but if more sooner
remedy be had for him in this behalf. Please it your gracious lordship
to grant several writs to be directed to the said John Wayte, Richard
Newport and John Newport, commanding them to appear before you at a
certain day by you to be limited to be examined of these premises and to
do and receive what good faith and conscience will in this behalf, and
that they moreover by your discretion be compelled to find sufficient
surety to keep the King's peace against your said beseecher and against
all the King's liege people, at the reverence of God and in the way of
charity.</p>

Pledges to prosecute{William Poleyn.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">{John Grene.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This is the answer of John Wayte to a bill put against him by John
Bishop before the King in his Chancery.</p>

<p>The said John Wayte saith by protestation that the said John Bishop is
his villein regardant to his manor of Lee in the county of Southampton,
and he and his ancestors and all those whose estate John Wayte hath in
the same manor have been seised of the said John Bishop and of his
ancestors as villeins regardant to the said manor from the time that no
mind is, and saving to the said John Wayte and his heirs all manner
advantage to seize and claim the same John Bishop and his heirs and
their blood, all their lands and tenements, goods and chattels, and all
manner other advantage and objections of bondage of and against the said
John Bishop and his blood hereafter, by protestation that the said John
Wayte is not guilty of no matter contained in the said bill like as by
the same bill it is supposed for plea, saith, inasmuch as all the
matters of complaint contained in the said bill be matters determinable
by the common law of this land in other courts of our sovereign lord the
King, and not in this court, asketh judgment and prayeth to be dismissed
out of this court after the form of the Statute.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the replication of John Bishop unto the answer of John Wayte.</p>

<p>The said John Bishop saith that he is a free man born and of free
condition and not bondman of the said John Wayte, and that all the
ancestors of the same John Bishop from the time that no mind is have
been free men and of free condition, born within the parish of Corfe in
the county of Dorset and not within the manor of Lee in the county of
Southampton, as by divers true inquisitions hereof taken before certain
commissioners by virtue of the king's commission to them directed it
plainly appeareth, which commissions and inquisitions remaineth in this
place of record; and he saith moreover that the said John Wayte
wrongfully by great force hath taken from him his goods and chattels and
him grievously imprisoned in the manner and form declared in his bill,
and him put to such cost, loss of his good, let of his labour and
business, and other great troubles and vexations, that he is so poor and
brought to so great misery that he is not of power to sue against the
said John Wayte for remedy of the said wrongs by course of the common
law of this land. Wherefore, inasmuch as he withsaith not the matter
contained in the said bill of complaint of the said John Bishop, he
prayeth that the said John Wayte may be compelled by the rule and
discretion of this court to restore him of his said goods and to give
him sufficient damages and amends for the said trespass to him done.</p>

<p>Inquisition taken there on the said Thursday by the oath of John
Baker<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> ... who say on their oath that Richard de Leycestre of Ely on
Saturday next after the feast of Corpus Christi in the 4th year of the
Lord the King that now is, of his own will made insurrection, gathering
to himself John Buk of Ely and many other evildoers unknown, and went
through the whole town of Ely, commanding that all men, of whatsoever
estate, should make insurrection and go with him to destroy divers
traitors whom he would name to them on behalf of the lord King Richard
and the faithful commons; and hereupon he made divers proclamations
seditiously and to the prejudice of the lord the King, whereby the
people of the same town of Ely and other townships of the isle aforesaid
were greatly disturbed and injured. Further they say that the same
Richard [de Leycestre] on Sunday following commanded John Shethere of
Ely, Elias Glovere, John Dassh, skinner, John Tylneye, wright, and John
Redere of Ely, Thomas Litstere of Ely, Richard Swonn of Ely and John
Milnere of Ely and many others of the commons there assembled, that they
should go with him to the monastery of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> Ely to stand with him, while he,
in the pulpit of the same monastery, should declare to them and all
others the matters to be performed on behalf of King Richard and the
commons against traitors and other disloyal men, and this under pain of
the burning of their houses and the taking off of their heads; and so
the same Richard [de Leycestre] was a notorious leader and assembler
feloniously, and committed all the aforesaid acts to the prejudice of
the crown of the lord the King. Further they say that the same Richard
on Monday next following at Ely, as principal leader and insurgent, with
the aforesaid men above named and many others unknown of his fellowship,
feloniously broke the prison of the lord Bishop of Ely at Ely and
feloniously led away divers felons there imprisoned.</p>

<p>And that the same Richard on the said Monday at Ely feloniously adjudged
to death Edmund de Walsyngham, one of the justices of the peace of the
lord the King in the county of Cambridge, whereby the said Edmund was
then feloniously beheaded and his head set on the pillory there, the
same being a pernicious example. And that the same Richard was the
principal commander and leader in all the felonies, seditions and other
misdeeds committed within the isle at the time aforesaid, etc.</p>

<p>And hereupon the aforesaid Richard was taken by the justices aforesaid
and afterwards brought before them and charged and diligently examined
touching all the felonies and seditions aforesaid, article by article,
in what manner he would acquit himself thereof; and he made no answer
thereto but proffered a protection of the lord the King granted to him
for the security of his person and his possessions to endure for one
year according to the form and effect used in the Chancery of the lord
the King; and he says that he does not intend to be annoyed or
disquieted touching any presentments made against him by the justices,
by virtue of the protection aforesaid, etc. And the aforesaid Richard
was asked if he would make any other answer to the premises under the
peril incumbent, in that the protection aforesaid is insufficient to
acquit him of the premises or of any article of the same. And hereupon
the same Richard made no further denial of any of the premises presented
against him, but said, "I cannot make further answer, and I hold myself
convicted." And because it is clear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> and plain enough to the aforesaid
justices that the same Richard is guilty of all the felonies and
seditions aforesaid, as has been found before the same justices in
lawful manner, therefore by the discretion of the said justices he was
drawn and hanged the same day and year, etc., and [it was adjudged] that
his lands and tenements, goods and chattels, should be forfeit to the
lord the King, as law requires. And order was made to Ralph atte Wyk,
escheator of the lord the King, that he should make due execution
thereof forthwith for the lord the King, etc. And it is to be known that
it was found before the aforesaid justices that the same Richard has a
shop in "le Bocherie" in Ely, which is worth yearly beyond reprises
10<i>s.</i>, and chattels to the value of 40 marks, which the same Ralph
seized forthwith, etc.</p>

<p>Further the aforesaid jurors say that John Buk of Ely was a fellow of
the aforesaid Richard Leycestre all the time of the insurrection and
tumult at Ely in the accomplishing of all the felonies, treasons and
misdeeds, whereof the said Richard was indicted. And specially that the
same John, of his malice, at the time when Edmund de Walsyngham was
adjudged to death, feloniously came to him and feloniously snatched a
purse of Edmund attached to his tunic containing 42&frac12;<i>d.</i>, and
violently assaulted the said Edmund, dragging him to the place of his
beheading, and carried away the said money except 12<i>d.</i> thereof which
he gave to John Deye of Willingham, who there feloniously beheaded
Edmund, for his labour. And hereupon the aforesaid John Buk was taken
and brought forthwith before the aforesaid justices and charged touching
the premises article by article, in what manner he will make answer
thereto or acquit himself. And he says that as to all the matters
touching Edmund de Walsyngham whereof he is charged, he came with many
others to see the end of the said Edmund and to hear the cause of his
death, and not otherwise, and this by the command of divers of the said
commons. And he was asked further by whose command he came there and
snatched the purse with the money aforesaid from the said Edmund in the
form aforesaid, and he said that he believes it was by command of the
devil. And he confessed further how and in what manner he dealt with the
aforesaid purse with the money aforesaid, as was found above. And to all
other presentments made against him he made no further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> answer. And
because it is clear and plain enough, as well by his own acknowledgment
as by lawful finding otherwise, that the same John is guilty of all the
felonies and treasons aforesaid, therefore by the discretion of the said
justices he was drawn and hanged, etc.; and [it was adjudged] that his
lands and tenements, goods and chattels, should be forfeit to the lord
the King, as law requires. And order was made to Ralph atte Wyk,
escheator of the lord the King, that he should make due execution
thereof forthwith for the lord the King, etc., because it was found
before the aforesaid justices that he has goods and chattels to the
value of 20<i>l.</i>, which the same Ralph seized forthwith and made further
execution, etc.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>[m. 10<i>d.</i>] <i>Ely.</i>&mdash;Adam Clymme was taken as an insurgent traitorously
against his allegiance, and because on Saturday next after the feast of
Corpus Christi in the 4th year of the reign of King Richard the second
after the Conquest, he traitorously with others made insurrection at
Ely, feloniously broke and entered the close of Thomas Somenour and
there took and carried away divers rolls, estreats of the green wax of
the lord the King and the Bishop of Ely, and other muniments touching
the Court of the lord the King, and forthwith caused them to be burned
there to the prejudice of the crown of the lord the King.</p>

<p>Further that the same Adam on Sunday and Monday next following caused to
be proclaimed there that no man of law or other officer in the execution
of duty should escape without beheading.</p>

<p>Further that the same Adam the day and year aforesaid at the time of the
insurrection was always wandering armed with arms displayed, bearing a
standard, to assemble insurgents, commanding that no man of whatsoever
condition he were, free or bond, should obey his lord to do any services
or customs, under pain of beheading, otherwise than he should declare to
them on behalf of the Great Fellowship. And so he traitorously took upon
him royal power. And he came, brought by the sheriff, and was charged
before the aforesaid justices touching the premises, in what manner he
would acquit himself thereof. And he says that he is not guilty of the
premises imputed to him or of any of the premises, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> hereof puts
himself on the country, etc. And forthwith a jury is made thereon for
the lord the King by twelve [good and lawful men] etc., who being chosen
hereto, tried and sworn, say on their oath that the aforesaid Adam is
guilty of all the articles. By the discretion of the justices the same
Adam is drawn and hanged, etc. And it was found there that the same Adam
has in the town aforesaid chattels to the value of 32<i>s</i>., which Ralph
atte Wyk, escheator of the lord the King, seized forthwith and made
further execution for the lord the King, etc.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Cambridge.</i>&mdash;John Shirle of the county of Nottingham was taken because
it was found that he was a vagabond in divers counties the whole time of
the disturbance, insurrection and tumult, carrying lies and worthless
talk from district to district whereby the peace of the lord the King
could be speedily broken and the people disquieted and disturbed; and
among other dangerous words, to wit, after the proclamation of the peace
of the lord the King made the day and year aforesaid, the assigns<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
of the lord the King being in the town and sitting, he said in a tavern
in Bridge Street, Cambridge, where many were assembled to listen to his
news and worthless talk, that the stewards of the lord the King, the
justices and many other officers and ministers of the King were more
worthy to be drawn and hanged and to suffer other lawful pains and
torments, than John Balle, chaplain, a traitor and felon lawfully
convicted; for he said that he was condemned to death falsely, unjustly
and for envy by the said ministers with the King's assent, because he
was a true and good man, prophesying things useful to the commons of the
realm and telling of wrongs and oppressions done to the people by the
King and the ministers aforesaid; and his death shall not go unpunished
but within a short space he would well reward both the King and his
officers and ministers aforesaid; which sayings and threats redound to
the prejudice of the crown of the lord the King and the contempt and
manifest disquiet of the people. And hereupon the aforesaid John Shirle
was brought forthwith by the sheriff before the aforesaid assigns in
Cambridge castle, and was charged touching the premises and diligently
examined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> as well touching his conversation as touching his tarrying and
his estate, and the same being acknowledged by him before the aforesaid
assigns, his evil behaviour and condition is plainly manifest and clear.
And hereupon trustworthy witnesses at that time in his presence, when
the aforesaid lies, evil words, threats and worthless talk were spoken
by him, were asked for, and they being sworn to speak the truth in this
behalf, testify that all the aforesaid words imputed to him were truly
spoken by him; and he, again examined, did not deny the premises imputed
to him. Therefore by the discretion of the said assigns he was hanged;
and order was made to the escheator to enquire diligently of his lands
and tenements, goods and chattels, and to make due execution thereof for
the lord the King.</p>

gild, and the part played by each in the evolution of municipal
self-government, present problems to which there is no simple solution.
The undoubtedly military object of many of the Saxon boroughs fails to
explain their economic development; while the possession of a market did
not lead of necessity to self-government. Often, indeed, there is little
economic difference between a large manor and a small town; the towns
pursued agriculture, and the manors engaged in industry. None the less
the early borough, with its court co-ordinate with the hundred court,
its special peace, and its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> market, stands out at the time of the
Conquest as a distinct variety of <i>communitas</i>, and easily became a
centre of specialised industry and privileged association.
Constitutional and economic growth proceed side by side; a measure of
liberty encourages commercial progress, and the profits of trade
purchase a larger measure of liberty.</p>

<p>In this section an attempt has been made to illustrate the gradual
expansion of the economic life of the town from the twelfth century
onwards. The twelfth and thirteenth centuries witnessed a great and
growing activity; craft gilds and gilds merchant were arising
everywhere, and whether licensed or unlicensed, were paying considerable
sums to the crown for privileges bought or usurped, (No. 1). The more
important boroughs were securing charters from their lords (Nos. 2 and
3), while smaller towns were struggling to win economic freedom, that is
to say, local monopoly, against serious obstacles (No. 5). The fate of a
town depended much on the lord; the king's boroughs were more favoured
than those of an earl or lesser baron, while the latter fared better
than towns in the hands of a prelate (Nos. 11 and 12). The exaction of
tolls and the claim to exemption from tolls, which prove the existence
of considerable intermunicipal trade, were a common cause of litigation.
The grant of incompatible privileges to rival communities was a source
of profit to the medi&aelig;val monarchy; the crown secured payment in hand
for the charters, and reaped the benefit of the inevitable dispute that
followed (Nos. 4 and 8). The growth of intercourse is further shown by
that curious feature of early borough development, the affiliation of
distinct groups of towns (No. 6). Nos. 7 and 10 illustrate the coveted
privileges of the freedom of a city or borough, and No. 9 the machinery
by which a citizen protected himself if his liberty were infringed in
another town. The character of tolls imposed by a town for municipal
purposes and the possibility of corrupt collectors are shown in Nos. 13
and 14. The specialisation of industry is naturally followed by a
differentiation of function, a process which develops normally in the
fourteenth century<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> and attains a certain rigidity in the fifteenth.
Crafts begin to close their ranks, to lay down elaborate rules of
membership, of the conduct of business and the methods of manufacture,
to secure incorporation, and to strengthen their hands by establishing
disciplinary precedents in relation to the journeymen and apprentices.
The competition of the unskilled outsider is suppressed and
apprenticeship insisted on (Nos. 15 and 17), the journeyman is
restrained (No. 16), and the crafts establish a wide control over the
conditions of labour (No. 18). No. 19 is a characteristic indenture of
apprenticeship; No. 20 illustrates the tendency to invoke the central
authority, which grows in force during the fifteenth century and
culminates in the direct control exercised by the Chancellor over gild
ordinances in the sixteenth century; while No. 21 is an example of the
social religious gild, which was one of the medi&aelig;val methods of
anticipating the poor law.</p>

Roll, 11 Edward III, m. 10, No.21</i>], 1314.</p>

<p>Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester and Hertford, to all whom the
present letters shall come, greeting. Whereas William and Robert,
sometime earls of Gloucester and Hertford,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> our progenitors, of
famous memory, formerly granted and confirmed in turn for them and their
heirs by their charters to their burgesses of Tewkesbury and their heirs
and successors the liberties below written:</p>

<p>First, that the burgesses of the borough aforesaid should have and hold
their burgages in the borough aforesaid by free service, to wit, each of
them holding one burgage should have and hold it by the service of
12<i>d.</i> a year to be rendered to the same earls, and if holding more
should have and hold each of them by the service of 12<i>d.</i> a year
together with the service of doing suit to the court of the same earls
of the borough aforesaid from three weeks to three weeks, for all
service, so that after the decease of any of the burgesses aforesaid,
his heir or heirs should enter the burgage or burgages aforesaid, of
what age soever he or they should be, to hold the same quit of relief or
heriot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>And to the same burgesses, each of them, that they might sell, pledge or
loan to other burgesses their burgage or burgages aforesaid which they
had in the same borough by purchase, at their will, without any ransom
to be made, so that those burgesses to whom such burgages were sold,
pledged or loaned, should show the charters or writings which they had
thereof before the steward of the aforesaid earls in the court of the
borough.</p>

<p>And if any of them should hold half a burgage, he should hold it with
the same liberty with which tenants of a whole burgage should hold and
have the same, according to the quantity of his burgage.</p>

<p>And that no burgess of the borough aforesaid should by reason of a
burgage or half a burgage be in any wise tallaged or make ransom of
blood or be disturbed by reason of the sale of his horse, ox or other
his chattels whatsoever, but each of them should employ his merchandise
without challenge.</p>

<p>And to the same burgesses, that they might make their wills and lawfully
in their wills bequeath at their pleasure their chattels and burgages
which they should hold by purchase.</p>

<p>And if it should happen that any of them were impoverished whereby he
must sell his burgage, he should first seek from his next hereditary
successor before his neighbours three times his necessaries in food and
clothing for the poverty of his estate, and if he should refuse to do it
for him, it should be lawful for him to sell his burgage at his will for
ever without challenge.</p>

<p>And to the same burgesses, that they might make bread for sale in their
own oven or that of another, and ale for sale in their own brewhouse or
that of another, save that they should keep the royal assize.</p>

<p>And that they might make ovens, drying-houses, hand mills without
hindrance of the earls aforesaid or their bailiffs whomsoever.</p>

<p>And that none of them should come without the borough aforesaid by any
summons to the hundred of the same earls of the honour of Gloucester in
the county aforesaid by reason of their burgages aforesaid.</p>

<p>And if a foreigner, who should not be a burgess nor the son of a
burgess, should buy a burgage or half a burgage in the same borough, he
should come to the court of the borough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> aforesaid next following and
make his fine for entry and do fealty.</p>

<p>And that all burgesses who should hold a burgage or half a burgage and
should sell bread and ale should come once at the Lawday yearly at the
Hockday and there be amerced for breach of the assize, if they ought to
be amerced, by the presentment of twelve men; so that each burgess
should answer for his household (<i>manupastu</i>), sons and tenants, unless
they should have been attached for any trespass to answer at the day
aforesaid.</p>

<p>And to the same burgesses, that they should be quit of toll and of
custom within the lordship of the aforesaid earls in the honour of
Gloucester and elsewhere in England, according as they used of old; so
that no foreigner should buy corn in the borough aforesaid nor put or
keep any in a granary beyond eight days, to wit, between the Gules of
August<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> and the feast of All Saints<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>; but if he did and were
convicted thereof, he should be amerced at the will of the aforesaid
earls or their bailiffs; nor after the feast of All Saints or [before]
the Gules of August should he buy corn to put and keep in a granary, nor
carry any by water without licence of the aforesaid earls or the
bailiffs of the borough aforesaid, and he should pay customs.</p>

<p>And that no foreigner should be received by the steward, clerk or any
other on behalf of the same earls to be within the liberty aforesaid,
unless it were testified by lawful men of the borough aforesaid, that he
were good and trusty.</p>

<p>And if any burgess should be out of the borough at the time of summons
of the court aforesaid and could not reasonably be forewarned, he should
not be amerced for default.</p>

<p>And if any foreigner should be received within the liberty of the
borough aforesaid, he should find mainpernors<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> that he would bear
himself in good manner and faithfully to the aforesaid earls and their
bailiffs, and would be tractable to the commonalty of the borough
aforesaid.</p>

<p>And that they, the burgesses, should be bailiffs and catch-polls<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> of
that borough as often as they should be elected hereto, at the will of
the aforesaid earls, their stewards and bailiffs, and by election of the
commonalty of the borough aforesaid from year to year.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>And that the burgesses aforesaid should have common pasture for their
beasts in the common pasture of the borough aforesaid, according to
their burgages which they have in the same borough, as they have been
accustomed hitherto.</p>

confirm them for us and our heirs for ever. These witnesses:&mdash;Sirs

Roll,11 Henry III, p.1, m. 10</i>, No. 88], 1227.</p>

<p>Henry, King, etc., greeting. Know ye that we have granted and by this
our charter confirmed to our burgesses of Gloucester the whole borough
of Gloucester with the appurtenances, to hold of us and our heirs for
ever at fee farm, rendering yearly 55<i>l.</i> sterling, as they were wont to
render the same, and 10<i>l.</i> by tale of increment of farm, at our
Exchequer at the term of Easter and at the term of Michaelmas. We have
granted also to our burgesses of Gloucester of the merchants' gild that
none of them plead without the walls of the borough of Gloucester
touching any plea save pleas of foreign tenures, except our moneyers and
ministers. We have granted also to them that none of them suffer trial
by battle and that touching pleas pertaining to our crown they may
deraign<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> according to the ancient custom of the borough. This also
we have granted to them that all burgesses of Gloucester of the
merchants' gild be quit of toll and lastage<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and pontage<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> and
stallage<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> within fairs and without and throughout seaports of all
our lands on this side the sea and beyond the sea, saving in all things
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> liberties of the city of London, and that none be judged touching a
money penalty save according to the ancient law of the borough which
they had in the time of our ancestors, and that they justly have all
their lands and tenements and sureties and debts, whosoever owe them,
and that right be done them according to the custom of the borough
touching their lands and tenures which are within the borough, and that
pleas touching all their debts by loans which they have made at
Gloucester, and touching sureties made there, be held at Gloucester. And
if any man in the whole of our land take toll or custom from the men of
Gloucester of the merchants' gild, after he have failed to do right, the
sheriff of Gloucester or the provost of Gloucester shall take distress
thereon at Gloucester, saving in all things the liberties of the city of
London. Furthermore for the repair of the borough we have granted to
them that they be all quit of "gyeresyeve"<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> and of "scotale,"<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
if our sheriff or any other bailiff exact "scotale." We have granted to
them these aforesaid customs and all other liberties and free customs
which they had in the times of our ancestors, when they had them well
and freely. And if any customs were unjustly levied in the time of war,
they shall be annulled. And whosoever shall come to the borough of
Gloucester with his wares, of whatsoever place they be, whether
strangers or others, shall come, stay and depart in our safe peace,
rendering right customs. And let no man disturb them touching this our
charter. And we forbid that any man commit wrong or damage or
molestation against them thereon on pain of forfeiture of 10<i>l.</i> to us.
Wherefore we will, etc. that the aforesaid burgesses and their heirs
have and hold all these things aforesaid in inheritance of us and our
heirs well and in peace, freely, quietly and honourably, as is above
written. We will also and grant that the same our burgesses of
Gloucester elect by the common counsel of the borough two of the more
lawful and discreet burgesses of Gloucester and present them to our
chief justice at Westminster, which two or one of them shall well and
faithfully keep the provostship of the borough and shall not be removed
so long as they be of good behaviour in their bailiwick, save by the
common counsel of the borough. We will also that in the same borough of
Gloucester by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> common counsel of the burgesses be elected four of
the more lawful and discreet men of the borough to keep the pleas of the
crown and other things which pertain to us and our crown in the same
borough, and to see that the provosts of that borough justly and
lawfully treat as well poor as rich, as the charter<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> of the lord
King John, our father, which they have thereon, reasonably testifies. We
have granted also to the same burgesses of Gloucester that none of our
sheriffs intermeddle with them in aught touching any plea or plaint or
occasion or any other thing pertaining to the aforesaid borough, saving
to us and our heirs for ever pleas of our crown, which ought to be
attached by the same our burgesses until the coming of our justices, as
is aforesaid. We have granted also to the same that if any bondman of
any man stay in the aforesaid borough and maintain himself therein and
be in the merchants' gild and hanse and lot and scot with the same our
burgesses for a year and a day without claim, thenceforth he shall not
be reclaimed by his lord, but shall abide freely in the same borough.

[<i>Bracton's Note-Book, II</i>, 121, No. 145], 1222.</p>

<p>The bailiffs of the city of Lincoln were summoned to answer the
burgesses of Beverley wherefore they permit them not to have their
liberties which they have by a charter of the lord King John, which
liberties they have used hitherto, etc.; whereon the burgesses say that
while they came through the middle of the town of Lincoln on their way
to the fair of St. Ives, the bailiffs took their pledges and their
cloths contrary to their liberty, and that they are injured and suffer
damage to the value of 60 marks, and thereof they produce their suit
etc. and proffer their charter,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> which testifies that the King gave
to God and St. John and the men of Beverley that they should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> be free
and quit of toll, pontage, passage, pesage, lastage, stallage and wreck
and all other such customs, which pertain to the lord the King himself,
throughout all the king's land, saving the liberties of London, etc.;
wherefore they say that by that charter they always had quittance of the
aforesaid customs until the last fair of St. Ives.</p>

<p>And the mayor of Lincoln and Robert son of Eudo, bailiffs of Lincoln,
come and deny force and tort, but acknowledge indeed that they took toll
from the complainants within their town, and this they could well do,
because they have charters of King Henry, grandfather of the lord the
King, and of King Richard, by which those kings granted to them all the
liberties and free customs which they had of the ancestors of those
kings, to wit, King Edward and King William and King Henry the
grandfather, throughout the whole land of England, and all the liberties
which the citizens of London have, saving to the same citizens of London
their liberties; and thereof they put forward their charters<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> which
witness the same; wherefore they say that by those charters they have
always had the liberty of taking toll in their town and always hitherto
were in seisin of that liberty, and they crave judgment if by the
charter of the lord King John they ought to lose their liberty granted
to them by his ancestors.</p>

<p>And the burgesses of Beverley say that after the charter of the lord
King John they never gave toll, nay rather, they were always quit
thereof by that charter, and this they offer to prove, etc. or to make
defence that they never gave toll; and being asked if before that
charter they gave toll, they say, Yes, and crave judgment hereon and
offer to the lord the King two palfreys for an inquisition if after the
charter of King John they were always quit of the aforesaid toll, and
they are received, and so a jury was made by eight lawful citizens of
Lincoln and further by eight lawful men of the vicinage of Lincoln, and
let it come on such a day to recognise if those burgesses, when they
brought wares through the town of Lincoln, were quit of toll in that
town from the first year of the coronation of King John.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

Rolls, Mich. 8 Henry III, m. 6</i>], 1223-4.</p>

<p><i>Buckingham.</i>&mdash;Alan Basset was summoned to answer the burgesses of
Wycombe wherefore he permits them not to have their gild merchant with
its appurtenances, as they were wont to have it in the time of the lord
King John, when he had that manor in his hand; whereof the burgesses say
that in the time when the lord King John had that manor in his hand, and
when the lord the King gave it to the same Alan, they had a gild
merchant and a liberty which the same Alan has taken away from them,
wherefore they are much injured, for by that gild merchant they had this
liberty, that no merchant within their town could sell cloths at retail,
neither linens nor woollens, unless he were in the gild merchant or by
licence of the bailiffs of the burgesses who were in the gild merchant,
and furthermore in the same manner could not sell fells or wood or
broom<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> or such merchandise, unless he were in the gild or by
licence, as aforesaid; and the same Alan contravened this liberty and
granted to all merchants and others that they might sell cloths at
retail and fells and such wares as they please, and takes 3<i>d.</i> toll;
and they used to give for the farm of the lord the King half a mark
yearly to have that liberty; and because he has taken away that liberty
from them, they are injured and suffer damage to the value of 40 marks,
and thereof they produce suit, and if this suffices not, they offer to
prove that they had such seisin by the evidence of witnesses (<i>per vivam
vocem</i>), if they ought, or by the body of a man,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> or by the
country,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> and they offer 20 marks to have an inquisition thereon.</p>

<p>And Alan comes and defends force and tort and says that he has taken no
liberties from them, but will speak the truth; the lord King John gave
him that manor with all its appurtenances for his homage and service for
20<i>l.</i> a year and for the service of one knight, so that never
afterwards did they have a gild merchant, although they often sued for
it and murmured among themselves, so that he often asked of them their
warrant, if they had any, and they show him none; and the town is
amended in that merchants and others can sell their merchandise; and so
they ought to have no gild.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>And the burgesses say that his statement is contrary to right, because
after his time, when he had that manor, they had that liberty, both
before his time and after, and they offer as before 20 marks to have an
inquisition thereon. Touching their warrant they say that they had a
charter of King Henry, grandfather of the lord the King, and it was
deposited in the church of Wycombe, and there in the time of war was
burned in the church, and thereof they put themselves on a jury.</p>

<p>And Alan defends that they had no charter thereof nor any warrant, nor
ever had seisin of that gild in his time, nor can he admit nor will he
admit any inquisition without the lord the King; but indeed it may be
true that when they had the manor of the King at farm, then they did
what they pleased.</p>

<p>A day is given to them on the morrow of Martinmas to hear their
judgment, and the burgesses put in their place William son of Harvey and
Robert le Taillur.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>The King to all, etc., greeting. Know ye that we have granted and by our
present charter confirmed to our burgesses of Bedford all their
liberties and customs and laws and quittances, which they had in the
time of the lord King Henry, our grandfather, specially their gild
merchant with all their liberties and customs in lands and islands, in
pastures and all other their appurtenances, so that no one who is not in
that gild do any trafficking with them in city or borough or town or
soke. Moreover we have granted and confirmed to them that they be quit
of toll and pontage and stallage and lastage and passage, and of assarts
and every other custom throughout the whole of England and Normandy by
land and water and by the seashore, "bilande and bistrande," and have
all other customs throughout the whole of England and their liberties
and laws which they have in common with our citizens of Oxford,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> and
do their trafficking in common with them within London and without and
in all other places. And if they have any doubt or contention touching
any judgment which they ought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> to make, they shall send their messengers
to Oxford, and what the citizens of Oxford shall adjudge hereon, that
they shall hold firm and fixed and certain without doubt, and do the
same. And we forbid that they plead without the borough of Bedford in
aught whereof they are charged, but of whatsoever they be impleaded,
they shall deraign themselves according to the laws and customs of our
citizens of Oxford, and this at Bedford and not elsewhere; because they
and the citizens of Oxford are of one and the same custom and law and
liberty. Wherefore we will and straitly command that our aforesaid
burgesses of Bedford have and hold their aforesaid liberties and laws
and customs and tenures well and in peace, freely and quietly, fully and
honourably, with soc and sac and tol and theam and infangenethef,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
and with all other their liberties and free customs and quittances, as
well and entirely as ever they had them in the time of King Henry, our
grandfather, and as fully and freely and entirely as our citizens of
Oxford have those liberties and as the charter of King Richard, our
uncle, which they have thereof, reasonably testifies. Witnesses as
above. Given [at Westminster on 24 March in the 11th year of our reign].</p>

<p>The King to archbishops, etc. greeting. Know ye that whereas a dispute
was raised in our Court before us between our good men of Marlborough,
complainants, and our good men of Southampton, deforciants, of toll
which the aforesaid men of Southampton took from our men of Marlborough
against their liberties which they have by charter of King John, our
father, and by our charter, as they asserted; at length by our licence
it is covenanted between them on this wise, that all our men of
Marlborough, who are in the gild merchant of Marlborough and will
establish the same, be quit for ever of all custom and all manner of
toll in the town of Southampton and in all the appurtenances thereof,
whereof the men of Southampton within their liberty can acquit the said
men of Marlborough, notwithstanding that the charter of the same men of
Southampton is prior to the charters of the aforesaid men of
Marlborough;<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> and in like manner that the men of Southampton be quit
of all custom and toll in the town of Marlborough. We, therefore,
willing that the aforesaid covenant be firm and stable for ever, grant
and confirm it for us and our heirs. Witnesses:&mdash;Richard, count of
Poitou and earl of Cornwall, our brother, etc., as above [17 June,

another town the right to exact toll, was that priority of grant
prevailed; <i>cf.</i> Bracton <i>f.</i> 56<i>b</i>. By grants of incompatible charters
the crown obtained fees from two sets of petitioners, and also costs
from the subsequent litigation.</p></div>

that in any tallage to be assessed on the community of our city of

year of the reign of King Edward son of King Henry.</p>

<p>Nicholas Fouk and others by conspiracy premeditated among them at the
town aforesaid, and by oath taken among them, making unlawful assemblies
of their own authority on Monday next after the feast of the Nativity of
the Blessed Virgin Mary in the thirtieth year of the lord the King that
now is,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> ordained and decreed that none should remain among them in
the said town having chattels worth 20<i>s.</i> who would not pay them 2<i>s.</i>
1<i>d.</i>, which payment they call among themselves hansing-silver, which
money they took on that pretext respectively from Reynold del Blackhouse
and Robert the Carpenter, men dwelling in the town aforesaid, and also
beyond this 12<i>d.</i> of gersom from each of the said Reynold and Robert.
And likewise ... they decreed among themselves that every man of the
same town having chattels to the value of 10 marks should pay them
46<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, which by that authority they took from Robert Scot, a man
dwelling in the aforesaid town. And also the same day and year they
decreed among themselves that no man should stay in the aforesaid town
be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>yond a year and a day without being distrained to take oath to
maintain their aforesaid assemblies and ordinances....</p>

<p>The aforesaid Nicholas Fouk and others readily acknowledge that the
Abbot is lord of the whole town aforesaid, and ought to appoint his
bailiffs to hold his court in the same town. But as for the conspiracy
aforesaid, etc., they make stout defence that they are not guilty of the
aforesaid conspiracy, etc. And as for the Abbot's charge against them
that they have made unlawful assemblies in the aforesaid town, decreeing
and ordaining that every man dwelling in the same town having chattels
to the value of 20<i>s.</i>, etc. as above, they say that the aforesaid Abbot
makes plaint unjustly, for they say that they have an alderman and a
gild merchant in the aforesaid town and are free burgesses, etc.,
rendering judgments by their alderman of pleas pleaded in the court of
the same abbot before his bailiffs in the town aforesaid. And that
without any trespasses or unlawful assemblies they meet at their
Gildhall in the same town, as often as need be, to treat of the common
profit and advantage of the men and burgesses of the aforesaid town, as
is quite lawful for them. And that they and their ancestors and
predecessors, burgesses, etc., have used such a custom from time whereof
no memory is, to wit, of taking 2<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> from every man dwelling in
the aforesaid town, being in the tithing of the Abbot of the place
aforesaid, having chattels to the value of 20<i>s.</i>, that he may trade
among them and enjoy their market customs in the same town, and likewise
of receiving 46<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> from every man of the town aforesaid having
chattels to the value of 10 marks to keep<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> their gild merchant. And
that there is the following custom among them beyond this, to wit, that
twelve burgesses of the aforesaid town have been accustomed to elect
four men of the same town yearly to keep their gild merchant, each of
whom shall have chattels to the value of 10 marks. Which four men so
elected have been accustomed to be forewarned by two burgesses of the
gild aforesaid, who are called <i>les Dyes</i>, to keep their gild aforesaid;
and the same men so elected have been accustomed to find pledges before
the alderman and burgesses in the Gildhall aforesaid to keep the gild
aforesaid, or that each of them would pay 46<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, who should
refuse to keep that gild. And for the doing hereof the alderman and
burgesses in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> the town aforesaid have been accustomed to distrain every
man in the same town having chattels to the value of 10 marks, wishing
to trade among them and to enjoy their market customs. And thus then
each of the aforesaid four men so elected should enjoy burgess-ship
among them and their custom hereafter, and the burgesses of the
aforesaid town in form aforesaid have been used to receive 2<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>,
etc. And this they are ready to verify, whereof they crave judgment,
etc....</p>

<p>The jurors say, etc. that ... the Abbot must answer whether the
aforesaid Nicholas Fouke and others have a gild merchant in the
aforesaid town or not, etc. The abbot says that they have not a gild
merchant nor cognisances of pleas pertaining to a gild merchant, nor a
commonalty nor a common seal nor a mayor; but they hold a gild at the
feast of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist in a certain place to
feast and drink together, there holding their unlawful assemblies and
taking from every man dwelling in the said town the aforesaid 2<i>s.</i>
1<i>d.</i> and also 46<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, levying such money from the men aforesaid,
that the payers thereof may be of their fellowship, by distraints made
upon them; and he does not deny that the ancestors of the aforesaid
Nicholas and others have been long accustomed to receive such extortions
of 2<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> and 46<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, but against the Law Merchant and
against the will of the aforesaid payers and against the peace, etc.,
and beyond the amount of a third part of their goods; and by such
extortions and ransoms they claim to make burgesses within his liberty
and lordship, which there pertains to the Abbot himself and to no other
to be done, etc.</p>

<p>A day is given.... It is awarded that the aforesaid Abbot [recover] his
damages of 199<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> against the aforesaid Nicholas and
others.... And let the same Nicholas and others be committed to gaol,
etc. Afterwards the aforesaid Nicholas and others came and made fine,
etc. And let certain others in the dispute be imprisoned for a month
owing to their poverty, etc. And the aforesaid Nicholas and others came
before the justices and satisfied the lord Abbot, etc.; therefore let
them be delivered from prison, etc.</p>

[<i>Inquisitions Miscellaneous, 87, No. 46</i>], 1322.</p>

<p>Inquisition taken at Leicester on Saturday next after the feast of St.
Barnabas the Apostle<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> in the 15th year of the reign of King Edward,
son of King Edward, before Roger Beler, guardian of the castles, lands
and tenements of Thomas, late earl of Lancaster,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and other enemies
and rebels of the lord the King in the County of Leicester, in the hand
of the lord the King by their forfeiture, by the oath of William le
Palmere of Leicester.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>....</p>

<p>Who say on their oath that in the time of Edmund, late earl of
Leicester, uncle of the lord the King that now is, while he had the
lordship of the town aforesaid, the men of the same town who were in the
gild of the same town gave nothing for the retailing or sale of cloth or
other merchandise, but in the time of Thomas, late earl of Leicester, by
distraints of farmers[185] and extortions they were compelled to make
heavy fines yearly.</p>

<p>Further, in the time of the aforesaid Edmund, the fullers dwelling in
the same town gave nothing to any man for exercising that craft, but in
the time of Thomas they were compelled to pay 40<i>s.</i> a year, so that the
aforesaid farmers would not permit other fullers to come into the same
town, whereby none remains in the same town save one only, and he is
poor.</p>

<p>Further, in the time of Edmund, the butchers of the same town used to
give nothing to any man for exercising their trade, but in the time of
Thomas they were compelled to give 10<i>s.</i> a year to the farmers.</p>

<p>Further, in the time of Edmund, for four days at Christmas no court of
pleas of the Portmanmoot used to be holden, but in the time of Thomas by
extortions and distraints the farmers<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> used to compel those who owed
to others any debt, upon plaint made against them, to pay their debts
within the aforesaid four days, or to imprison their bodies until they
should have paid.</p>

<p>In the time of Edmund vendors of oatmeal sold their meal, giving nothing
to any man except toll; in the time of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> Thomas they were not permitted
to sell the aforesaid meal except by great measures, and then the
beadles of the farmers of the same town took by extortion from the
buyers a great quantity for measuring it, and to have that profit the
said beadles gave to the farmers 40<i>s.</i> a year.</p>

<p>Further, in the time of Edmund, the farmers of the demesne lands of the
same Edmund used to have the dung found in the four high roads and not
elsewhere in the lanes; in the time of Thomas, by force and might they
collected and took the dung in all the lanes, against the will of the
burgesses.</p>

<p>Further, in the time of Edmund, from payers of toll the farmers used to
take nothing by way of a double toll, and that by view of any of the
jurors of the same town; in the time of Thomas the farmers took from
payers of toll the heaviest ransoms at their will, exceeding the value
of the thing whereon the toll was so paid, and often more than the true
value.</p>

<p>Further, in the time of Edmund, the porters of the castle of the town of
Leicester meddled not in the town of Leicester with the making of any
attachments, except with a bailiff of the same town; in the time of
Thomas, by force and might they made attachments and other executions
without any bailiff of the town, and wrought great wrongs in the said
town, whereby the burgesses suffered great grievances.</p>

<p>In the time of Edmund, if any burgess were impleaded in the court of the
castle, the mayor and bailiffs of the same town used to claim their
court and freely have it at the Portmanmoot; in the time of Thomas the
farmers refused to admit their claims or to grant their court, but
compelled burgesses to answer there by various and heavy distraints.</p>

<p>Further, in the time of Edmund, buyers of wool used to hire carts to
carry their wool at their will; in the time of Thomas they were
compelled to give to the farmers 1<i>d.</i> on each sack and could hire carts
only at the will of the said farmers.</p>

<p>Further, in the time of Edmund, the foresters of "le Fruth" used not to
make attachments in the town of Leicester nor meddle there for any
trespasses of dry wood committed; in the time of Thomas, by extortion,
force and might, they made attachments both upon those who bought at
their doors from poor women carrying dry sticks on their heads, and upon
others, and caused the buyers to be amerced at the court of "le
Hethilegh."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>In the time of Edmund, the brewers of the same town used to be amerced
once a year according to the measure of their guilt and at the rate of
6<i>d.</i> or 12<i>d.</i> at most; in the time of Thomas, the farmers levied from
the same by extortions and heavy ransoms at their will from one half a
mark and from another 10<i>s.</i>, which they call farms of "Cannemol."</p>

<p>Further, in the time of Edmund, the weavers of the same town used to
give nothing to any man for exercising their trade; in the time of
Thomas the said farmers took by extortion from every weaver 40<i>d.</i> for
permission to work in broad cloth.</p>

<p>Further, in the time of Edmund the vendors of salt herrings and fish
could sell such their merchandise by themselves and their servants
(<i>servos</i>) with their own hands, giving nothing of their own except
toll; in the time of Thomas they were not permitted to sell their
merchandise, but the ministers of the farmers deputed hereto sold the
same and took great sums of money by extortion.</p>

<p>Further, in the time of Edmund, retailers of cloth selling in their
windows used not to be amerced except by view of jurors of the same town
and once a year at 12<i>d.</i>; in the time of Thomas they were compelled by
heavy extortions to make fines at his will.</p>

<p>In witness whereof the jurors have set their seals to this inquisition.</p>

Roll, 10 Edward III, m. 22</i>], 1336.</p>

<p>The King to his beloved and faithful John de Mounteny, Nicholas de
Beaulu, Robert Scuffyn, and William de Merston, greeting. Know ye that
whereas on the 8th day of May in the second year of our reign by our
letters patent we granted unto the venerable father Henry, bishop of
Lincoln, that he should have in the town of Newark pavage for the term
of three years next following, and afterwards, wishing to do further
grace to the same bishop in this behalf, we granted unto him that from
the end of the term aforesaid he should take in the town aforesaid such
pavage until the end of four years then next following, the collection
of which pavage amounts to no small sum, as it is said; and we have
received a petition shown before us and our council, containing that the
collectors of the pavage aforesaid in the time aforesaid have detained
by them the money which they have collected from that pavage by virtue
of the grants aforesaid, and still detain the same, converting it to
other uses than to the repair and amendment of that town, as would be
fitting, to the deception of us and contrary to the form of the grants
aforesaid: We, wishing to apply a remedy in this behalf, as well for us
as for the safety of the town aforesaid in times to come, as we are
bound, have appointed you, three and two of you, to survey all works, if
any have been done by the collectors aforesaid from such money levied
and collected during the time of the grants aforesaid in the same town,
and to enquire, if need be, of the names of the collectors aforesaid,
and to cause those collectors to come before you, three or two of you,
and to hear and determine finally the account of all the same collectors
of all their receipts from the time aforesaid for such cause, and to
distrain the same collectors to apply without delay in such repair all
money levied on account of the premises and not applied in the repair
aforesaid, and to appoint and depute certain fit collectors of the
pavage aforesaid in the town aforesaid of the same town, to collect and
levy the money there and to apply the same in the repair and amendment
of the pavage aforesaid in times to come, as you shall deem best to be
done according to your discretions for our advantage and the safety of
the town aforesaid. And therefore we command you that at certain days
which you, three or two of you, shall provide herefor, you hear and
determine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> the account aforesaid, and do and accomplish all and singular
the premises in the form aforesaid; for we have commanded our sheriff of
Nottingham that at certain days which you, three or two of you, shall
cause him to know, he cause to come before you, three or two of you, the
collectors aforesaid, and as many and such good and lawful men of his
bailiwick by whom the truth of the matter in the premises may the better
be known and enquired of. In witness whereof, etc. Witness the King at
Walsingham, 15 February. By petition of the Council.</p>

Letter-Book F, f. 126</i>], 1346.</p>

<p>In honour of God, of Our Lady, and of all Saints, and for the nurture of
tranquillity and peace among the good folks the Megucers, called
"<i>Whittawyers</i>," the folks of the same trade have, by assent of Richard
Lacer, Mayor, and of the Aldermen, ordained the points underwritten.</p>

<p>In the first place, they have ordained that they will find a wax candle,
to burn before Our Lady in the Church of All Hallows near London Wall.
Also, that each person of the said trade shall put in the box such sum
as he shall think fit, in aid of maintaining the said candle.</p>

<p>Also, if by chance any one of the said trade shall fall into poverty,
whether through old age, or because he cannot labour or work, and have
nothing with which to help himself; he shall have every week from the
said box 7<i>d.</i> for his support if he be a man of good repute. And after
his decease, if he have a wife, a woman of good repute, she shall have
weekly for her support 7<i>d.</i> from the said box, so long as she shall
behave herself well, and keep single.</p>

<p>And that no stranger shall work in the said trade, or keep house [for
the same] in the city, if he be not an apprentice, or a man admitted to
the franchise of the said city.</p>

<p>And that no one shall take the serving man of another to work with him,
during his term, unless it be with the permission of his master.</p>

<p>And if any one of the said trade shall have work in his house that he
cannot complete, or if for want of assistance such work shall be in
danger of being lost, those of the said trade shall aid him, that so the
said work be not lost.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>And if any one of the said trade shall depart this life, and have not
wherewithal to be buried, he shall be buried at the expense of their
common box; and when any one of the said trade shall die, all those of
the said trade shall go to the Vigil, and make offering on the morrow.</p>

<p>And if any serving-man shall conduct himself in any other manner than
properly towards his master, and act rebelliously towards him, no one of
the said trade shall set him to work, until he shall have made amends
before the Mayor and Aldermen; and before them such misprision shall be
redressed.</p>

<p>And that no one of the said trade shall behave himself the more
thoughtlessly, in the way of speaking or acting amiss, by reason of the
points aforesaid; and if any one shall do to the contrary thereof, he
shall not follow the said trade until he shall have reasonably made
amends.</p>

<p>And if any one of the said trade shall do to the contrary of any point
of the Ordinances aforesaid, and be convicted thereof by good men of the
said trade, he shall pay to the Chamber of the Guildhall of London, the
first time 2<i>s.</i>, the second time 40<i>d.</i>, the third time half a mark,
and the fourth time 10<i>s.</i>, and shall forswear the trade.</p>

<p>Also, that the good folks of the same trade shall once in the year be
assembled in a certain place, convenient thereto, there to choose two
men of the most loyal and befitting of the said trade, to be overseers
of work and all other things touching the trade, for that year, which
persons shall be presented to the Mayor and Aldermen for the time being,
and sworn before them diligently to enquire and make search, and loyally
to present to the said Mayor and Aldermen such defaults as they shall
find touching the said trade without sparing any one for friendship or
for hatred, or in any other manner. And if any one of the said trade
shall be found rebellious against the said overseers, so as not to let
them properly make their search and assay, as they ought to do; or if he
shall absent himself from the meeting aforesaid, without reasonable
cause, after due warning by the said overseers, he shall pay to the
Chamber, upon the first default, 40<i>d.</i>; and on the second like default,
half a mark; and on the third, one mark; and on the fourth, 20<i>s.</i> and
shall forswear the trade for ever.</p>

<p>Also, that if the overseers shall be found lax and negligent about their
duty, or partial to any person, for gift or for friend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>ship, maintaining
him, or voluntarily permitting him [to continue] in his default, and
shall not present him to the Mayor and Aldermen, as before stated, they
are to incur the penalty aforesaid.</p>

<p>Also, that each year, at such assemblies of the good folks of the said
trade, there shall be chosen overseers, as before stated. And if it
shall be found that through laxity or negligence of the said governors
such assemblies are not held, each of the said overseers is to incur the
said penalty.</p>

<p>Also, that all skins falsely and deceitfully wrought in their trade,
which the said overseers shall find on sale in the hands of any person,
citizen or foreigner, within the franchise, shall be forfeited to the
said Chamber, and the worker thereof amerced in manner aforesaid.</p>

<p>Also, that no one who has not been an apprentice, and has not finished
his term of apprenticeship in the said trade shall be made free of the
same trade; unless it be attested by the overseers for the time being or
by four persons of the said trade, that such person is able, and
sufficiently skilled to be made free of the same.</p>

<p>Also, that no one of the said trade shall induce the servant of another
to work with him in the same trade, until he has made a proper fine with
his first master, at the discretion of the said overseers, or of four
reputable men of the said trade. And if any one shall do to the contrary
thereof, or receive the serving workman of another to work with him
during his term, without leave of the trade, he is to incur the said
penalty.</p>

<p>Also, that no one shall take for working in the said trade more than
they were wont heretofore, on the pain aforesaid, that is to say, for
the <i>dyker</i><a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> of <i>Scottes stagges</i>, half a mark; the <i>dyker of
Yrysshe</i>, half a mark; the <i>dyker of Spanysshe stagges</i> 10<i>s.</i>; for the

Journeymen</span> [<i>Guildhall, Letter-Book II, f. 309</i>], 1396.</p>

<p>Whereas there had arisen no small dissension and strife between the
masters of the trade of Saddlers of London, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> the serving-men, called
<i>yomen</i>, in that trade; because that the serving-men aforesaid against
the consent, and without leave of their masters, were wont to array
themselves all in a new and like suit once in the year, and often times
held divers meetings, at Stratford and elsewhere without the liberty of
the said city, as well as in divers places within the city; whereby many
inconveniences and perils ensued to the trade aforesaid; and also, very
many losses might happen thereto in future times, unless some quick and
speedy remedy should by the rulers of the said city be found for the
same; therefore the masters of the said trade on the 10th day of the
month of July, in the 20th year, etc., made grievous complaint thereon
to the excellent men, William More, Mayor, and the Aldermen of the City
aforesaid, urgently entreating that, for the reasons before mentioned,
they would deign to send for Gilbert Dustone, William Gylowe, John Clay,
John Hiltone, William Berigge, and Nicholas Mason, the then governors of
the serving-men aforesaid; to appear before them on the 12th day of July
then next ensuing.</p>

<p>And thereupon, on the same 10th day of July, precept was given to John
Parker, serjeant of the Chamber, to give notice to the same persons to
be here on the said 12th day of July, etc. Which Governors of the
serving-men appeared, and, being interrogated as to the matters
aforesaid, they said that time out of mind the serving-men of the said
trade had had a certain Fraternity among themselves, and had been wont
to array themselves all in like suit once in the year, and, after
meeting together at Stratford, on the Feast of the Assumption of the
Blessed Virgin Mary<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> to come from thence to the Church of St.
Vedast, in London, there to hear Mass on the same day, in honour of the
said glorious Virgin.</p>

<p>But the said masters of the trade asserted to the contrary of all this,
and said that the fraternity, and the being so arrayed in like suit
among the serving-men, dated from only thirteen years back, and even
then had been discontinued of late years; and that under a certain
feigned colour of sanctity, many of the serving-men in the trade had
influenced the journeymen among them and had formed covins thereon, with
the object of raising their wages greatly in excess; to such an extent,
namely, that whereas a master in the said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> trade could before have had a
serving-man or journeyman for 40 shillings or 5 marks yearly, and his
board, now such a man would not agree with his master for less than 10
or 12 marks or even 10 pounds, yearly; to the great deterioration of the
trade.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>And further, that the serving-men aforesaid according to an ordinance
made among themselves, would oftentimes cause the journeymen of the said
masters to be summoned by a beadle, thereunto appointed, to attend at
Vigils of the dead, who were members of the said Fraternity, and at
making offering for them on the morrow, under a certain penalty to be
levied; whereby the said masters were very greatly aggrieved, and were
injured through such absenting of themselves by the journeymen, so
leaving their labours and duties against their wish.</p>

<p>For amending and allaying the which grievances and dissensions, the
Mayor and Aldermen commanded that six of the said serving-men should
attend in the name of the whole of the alleged Fraternity, and
communicate with six or eight of the master saddlers aforesaid, etc.,
both parties to be here, before the said Mayor and Aldermen on the 19th
day of July then next ensuing to make report to the Court as to such
agreement between them as aforesaid. And further, the Mayor and Aldermen
strictly forbade the said serving-men in any manner to hold any meeting
thereafter at Stratford aforesaid, or elsewhere without the liberty of
the said city on pain of forfeiture of all that unto our Lord the King
and to the said city they might forfeit.</p>

<p>On which 19th day of July, came here as well the masters aforesaid as
the governors of the serving-men; and presented to the Mayor and
Aldermen a certain petition, in these words: "Gilbert Dustone, William
Gylowe, John Clay, John Hiltone, William Berigge, and Nicholas Mason, do
speak on behalf of all their Fraternity and do beg of the Wardens of the
Saddlers that they may have and use all the points which heretofore they
have used."</p>

<p>Which petition having been read and heard, and divers reasons by the
said masters unto the Mayor and Aldermen shown, it was determined that
the serving-men in the trade aforesaid should in future be under the
governance and rule<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> of the masters of such trade; the same as the
serving-men in other trades in the same city are wont, and of right are
bound to be; and that in future they should have no fraternity,
meetings, or covins, or other unlawful things under a penalty, etc. And
that the said masters must properly treat and govern their serving-men
in the trade in such manner as the serving-men in like trades in the
city have been wont to be properly treated and governed. And that if any
serving-men should in future wish to make complaint to the Mayor and
Aldermen, for the time being, as to any grievance unduly inflicted upon
him by the masters aforesaid, such Mayor and Aldermen would give to him
his due and speedy meed of justice as to the same.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>17. <span class="smcap"><a name="Ordinances_of_the_Dyers_of_Bristol" id="Ordinances_of_the_Dyers_of_Bristol"></a>Ordinances of the Dyers of Bristol</span> [<i>Patent Roll, 13 Henry
IV, p. 2, m. 31</i>], 1407.</p>

<p>These are the petition, ordinances and articles, which are granted and
confirmed to the masters, burgesses of the craft of dyeing of the town
of Bristol ... by the assent and advice of the whole Common Council ...
holden in the Gildhall of Bristol ... the 8th year of the reign of King
Henry the Fourth after the Conquest, to endure for ever, as well for the
honour of the town of Bristol as for the profit and amendment of the
said craft; the tenour of which petition and ordinances follows
hereafter:</p>

<p>To the honourable and discreet Sirs, the Mayor, Sheriff and Bailiffs of
the town of Bristol, and to all the honourable folk of the Common
Council, the said masters make supplication: Whereas certain persons of
the said town of divers crafts, not cunning in the craft of dyeing, who
were never apprentices nor masters of the said craft, take upon them
divers charges and bargains to dye cloths and wools of many folk of the
same town and the country round, which cloths and wools have been divers
times ill dressed and worked through their ignorance and lack of
knowledge, to the great damage of the owners and scandal of the whole
craft aforesaid and of the drapery of the same town; whereupon, most
wise Sirs, please it your special grace to grant to the said suppliants
the ordinances underwritten, to put out and bring to nought all deceits
and damages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> which could hereafter befal within the craft aforesaid, and
this for God and as a work of charity.</p>

<p>First, be it ordained and assented that each year two masters of the
said craft be elected by the common assent of all the masters of the
same craft in the town of Bristol, and their names presented to the
Mayor of Bristol in full court of the Gildhall of the same town, and
there to be sworn on the Holy Gospels within the quinzaine of Michaelmas
at the latest to survey well and lawfully all manner of defects which
shall be made henceforward as well in dyed cloths as in wools put in
woad within the franchise of Bristol. And if any damage is done to any
person through defect of dyeing by any man or woman of the said craft,
that then he shall pay sufficient amends to the parties damaged
according to the discretion of the said two masters and of four other
indifferent persons elected by the Mayor and his Council, as the
trespass demands. And if it so be that any man or woman will not abide
by the ordinance and award of the said two masters and other indifferent
persons elected by the Mayor as before is said, that then the Mayor and
his council for the time being shall cause them to be compelled to pay
and satisfy the said persons so damaged of all that is adjudged by them.
And in case that the said two masters after their oath made be negligent
in executing their office touching their said mistery, that they be
punished and amerced according to the advice of the Mayor and of the
court aforesaid so the use of the chamber and to the common profit as is
aforesaid.</p>

<p>Further, that no servant or apprentice of the said mistery be henceforth
admitted to the liberties of Bristol to be a burgess sworn to exercise
the said mistery until it be testified to the court before the Mayor of
Bristol by the said two masters that they are able and well learned in
the said craft of dyeing, to save and keep the goods of the good folk
who are wont to be served for their money in the exercise of the mistery
aforesaid. And if any master of the said mistery make any such servant
or apprentice, if he be not able and well learned in the said craft, as
before is said, he shall incur the penalty of 20<i>s.</i> for each time, to
wit, to the use and profit of the commonalty, as before is said, 13<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i>, and to the masters for their light, 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, without any
pardon, provided always that the Mayor of the town of Bristol have his
power and jurisdiction to accept and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> make burgesses of each person
presented to him, as has been used and accustomed before these times,
these ordinances notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Further, forasmuch as often before these times divers folk, as well
those who have not been apprentices, servants or masters of the said
mistery, as other folk who are of other misteries, not cunning nor
having knowledge in the aforesaid art of dyeing, have taken upon them to
dye cloths and wools put in woad, as well of good folk of the town as of
the country round, which, by reason of ill management and through lack
of knowledge of the said folk, are greatly impaired of their colours and
many other defects to the great loss and damage of the owners of the
said cloths and great scandal of the town and shame of the whole craft
aforesaid, whereby the masters and apprentices of the said craft of
dyeing go vagrant for lack of work, because the said folk of other
crafts have been occupied in their said craft, to their great mischief
and undoing, therefore it is ordained and assented that henceforward no
manner of man of the same craft nor any other mistery do dye any cloth
or wool, unless it be presented by the said masters that he be good and
able and sufficiently learned in the said craft, upon pain of paying to
the Mayor and Bailiffs of the chamber for the use and common profit, as
before is said, at the first default 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., at the second default
13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., at the third default 20<i>s</i>., and for each default after
the said three defaults 20<i>s</i>., without any pardon, so that the said
masters have for their labour the third part arising from the said
defaults for their light, provided always that all the burgesses of this
town may make their profit for dyeing in their houses their own cloths,
as has been used before these times, these ordinances notwithstanding.</p>

<p>And after the view of the said petition and ordinances aforesaid by the
Mayor and Common Council, it was assented that all the masters of the
said mistery of dyeing dwelling within the franchise of Bristol should
come before the Mayor to hear their said ordinances and whether they
would assent thereto and grant them or not. And by command of the ...
Mayor, Ralph Dyer ... and many others of the mistery aforesaid came in
their own persons, to whom all the said ordinances were published and
declared, and every of them in the presence of the Mayor aforesaid
granted and assented to all the ordinances and pains aforesaid, praying
of their common assent that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> the ordinances and pains aforesaid be
ratified, confirmed and enrolled of record in the papers of the Gildhall
of Bristol, and be put in due execution for ever, saving always to the
jurisdiction of the Mayor and Common Council of the town of Bristol that
if any ordinance or any new addition hereafter touching the mistery
aforesaid which may be profitable as well for the town as for the
aforesaid mistery, that then by the advice and ordinance of the Mayor of
Bristol for the time being and the Council of the town and also of the
masters of the said mistery, they shall be corrected and amended
according to good faith and reason and put in due execution, the
ordinances aforesaid notwithstanding. Provided also that the dyers
abovesaid be bound by these ordinances to make the assay of woad and to
work wools and cloths as well in woad as in madder of the goods of all
merchants and burgesses of Bristol, taking for their labour reasonably
as has been accustomed and used before these times. In witness whereof,
at the special prayer and request of the said masters to keep and
maintain their ordinances aforesaid, we have put hereto the seal of the
office of the Mayoralty of the town of Bristol. Given in the Gildhall of
the same town 17 March, 8 Henry IV.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>The documents in this section are suggestive rather than comprehensive.
No attempt has been made to illustrate the industrial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> and commercial
development of England as a whole; but its more important aspects are
indicated, and the machinery of administration outlined. Down to the end
of the thirteenth century industry is of local rather than of national
importance, and is regulated by custom rather than by law; while there
was undoubtedly considerable intercourse between town and town, the
conduct of trade, the oversight of conditions of labour, and the
settlement of disputes were matters for the townsmen themselves to deal
with in accordance with chartered rights or intermunicipal covenants.
For example, the unpaid debt of an individual burgess was exacted by the
<i>communitas burgensium</i> to which the injured creditor belonged, from any
member of the <i>communitas burgensium</i> to which the defaulting debtor
belonged, by the method of forcible seizure of goods. Although,
therefore, the state attempted to secure uniformity of weights and
measures and of cloth, and to maintain the quality and cheapness of the
necessaries of life in the interests of traders and consumers alike,
none the less the assizes of weights and measures and of cloth (No. 1),
of bread and ale (Nos. 2 and 3) and of wine, came to be regarded, as
might be expected in a feudal age, as franchises to be purchased by the
lord of a manor, or enforced by the elected officers of a town. The
regulation of trade and industry shares the characteristic features of
its environment.</p>

<p>The same is true of early commercial intercourse with foreign
communities. The right to hold a fair is a liberty granted by the crown
to a lord, and for centuries the great fairs were the chief
international marts (Nos. 4-7, 30). The freedom which alien merchants
enjoyed under a clause of <i>Magna Carta</i> was extended by charters
granting privileges similar in detail to those procured by English towns
(Nos. 29-31), and it is not until the reign of Edward I. that a serious
attempt is made to nationalise regulation (Nos. 8-11). Thereafter
conflicts arise not only between the central legislature and the local
chartered body or privileged lord (No. 11), but between a growing
self-conscious merchant class and the alien com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>munities which had
hitherto controlled the export and import trade of the country (Nos. 21,
22). The State assumes new responsibilities, and Parliament attempts to
standardise old and enforce new regulations for the nation at large
(Nos. 12, 18, 19, 25). The Statute emerges over against the Charter on
the one hand and the Ordinance on the other. The difficulties of
Parliament are twofold; it has to fight, first, against old concessions
which would be upheld by the Courts (No. 11), and second, against the
uncertain operation of the royal prerogative (No. 34). It has often been
urged that the medi&aelig;val statute was little more than the expression of
an ideal, and that administrative machinery was insufficient for its
adequate execution. The truth is rather that Parliament was one of
several competing regulative institutions, and that notwithstanding the
most punctilious and inquisitorial administrative methods, its measures
were neutralised by existing privileges and by fresh exemptions
extracted from a chronically bankrupt and insincere monarchy. That the
administration was not of itself ineffective is clear from the
enforcement of the Statutes of Labourers in the fourteenth century (Nos.
12-17) and of the Statute of 18 Henry VI restricting the freedom of
aliens in the fifteenth century (Nos. 33, 34). The Crown was always
preoccupied with the state of the revenue; statutes are enforced or
overridden, according as their operation will benefit or deplete the
Exchequer. It was the experience of centuries that gave point to queen
Elizabeth's affection for the prerogative. None the less great strides
were made in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries towards the end
largely achieved in the Tudor period. The Elizabethan legislation sums
up and rounds off the work of the previous two hundred years. The
regulation of wages and of the conditions of labour (Nos. 12-19), the
protection of industry, commerce and shipping, making national trade an
important factor in international diplomacy (Nos. 20, 22, 25,27,28), the
emergence of a native mercantile class eager to win the export trade for
their own country by means of the staple (Nos. 20-24), the jealousy of
the alien, growing in intensity throughout the fourteenth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> and fifteenth
centuries (Nos. 21, 33, 34, 35), the development of a home cloth
manufacture competing with the best foreign products (Nos. 22, 25, 32),
and the provision of remedies against the medi&aelig;val bugbear of usury
(Nos. 36, 37), all assist in the gradual ripening of a national economy,
the fruits of which were gathered first in the Tudor era.</p>

33], 1197.</p>

<p>It is established that all measures of the whole of England be of the
same amount, as well of corn as of vegetables and of like things, to
wit, one good horse load; and that this measure be level as well in
cities and boroughs as without. Also the measure of wine and ale and of
all liquids shall be of the same amount according to the diversity of
liquids. Weights and measures also, great and small, shall be of the
same amount in the whole realm, according to the diversity of wares.
Measures also of corn and liquids, wine and ale, shall have marks put
thereon,<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> lest by guile they can be falsified.</p>

<p>It is established that woollen cloths, wherever they be made, be made of
the same width, to wit, of two ells within the lists,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and of the
same good quality in the middle and at the sides.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> Also the ell shall be
the same in the whole realm and of the same length, and the ell shall be
of iron.</p>

<p>It is forbidden to all merchants throughout the whole of the realm that
any merchant set in front of his shop red or black cloths or shields or
any other thing, whereby the buyers' eyes are often deceived in the
choice of good cloth.</p>

<p>It is also forbidden that any dye for sale, save black only, be made
anywhere in the realm, except in cities or chief boroughs.</p>

<p>It is also established that in every city or borough four or six lawful
men of the same town, according to the size of the town, together with
the sheriff,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> or with the reeves of the city or borough, if the same
be not in the hand of the sheriff, be assigned to keep the assize in
this form: that they see and be sure that all things are sold and bought
by the same measure, and that all measures are of the same size
according to the diversity of wares. And if they find any who shall be
confessed or convicted of having sold by other than the established
measure, his body shall be taken and sent to prison, and all his
chattels shall be seized into the hand of the lord the King, nor shall
he be delivered save by the lord the King or his chief justice. Touching
the keepers themselves it is established that if they perform this
keeping so negligently that they be convicted by others than themselves
before the justices of the lord the King of transgressing any written
assize either of measures or of the width of cloths, the keepers shall
remain at the mercy of the lord the King touching their chattels.</p>

<p>It is commanded also that after the feast of the Purification of St.
Mary no man in any county sell anything save by the ordained measure,
which shall be [everywhere] of the same size; nor after the fair of
mid-Lent at Stamford sell any cloth of smaller width than two ells
within the lists.</p>

<p>On the Saturday next before the Feast of the Invention of the Holy
Cross,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> in the 9th year of the reign of King Edward, son of King
Edward, Richard de Lughteburghe was attached to make answer as to a
certain false wastel<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> loaf of his. And the same Richard said that he
was not a baker, and that he did not have that wastel bread baked; but
that, as a regrator, he bought it of a certain baker who lives in
Southwark.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> And upon this he was charged by the Mayor and Aldermen with
being in partnership with the baker aforesaid, in baking such bread, and
sharing with him in the gain thereby, or loss, if such should happen:
whereupon, being asked how he would acquit himself thereof, he said that
he was not the partner of the said baker, nor had he any share with him;
and he put himself upon the country as to the same. Therefore the
country was summoned for the Tuesday next ensuing, and he was delivered
into the custody of the sheriffs, etc.</p>

<p>On which day the said Richard came, and the jury came by John de Estwode
and others in the panel named. Which jurors said upon their oath, that
the aforesaid Richard is a partner of the said baker for gain in baking
the bread aforesaid. Therefore it was adjudged that he should have the
punishment of the hurdle. And he was so punished now for the first time,
because his loaf was wanting to the amount of 2<i>s.</i> <i>9d.</i> in the proper
weight of half a mark for the halfpenny wastel loaf.</p>

<p>Also Alan de Lyndeseye, baker, was sentenced to the pillory, because he
had been convicted of baking <i>pain demaign</i> that was found to be of bad
dough within, and good dough without. And because such falsity redounds
much to the deception of the people who buy such bread, he was committed
for punishment, etc.</p>

<p class='center'>Court on Saturday [24 April, 1288].</p>

<p>John son of John of Eltisley makes plaint of Roger the Barber that he
has unjustly broken a covenant with him, because, whereas the same John
was in the town of Ramsey on Monday next after the Epiphany of the Lord
last past, a year ago, in the house of Thomas Buk, the said Roger came
there and undertook to cure his head of baldness for <i>9d.</i>, which he
paid in hand. On Tuesday the aforesaid Roger put him in plaster, and on
Wednesday likewise, and afterwards withdrew from the town, so that from
that day to this he would have nothing to do with the matter, to John's
damage of &frac12; mark; and he produces suit. The aforesaid Roger, being
present, denied [tort and force] and put himself on his law,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> and in
finding pledges of his law withdrew from the bar without licence.
Therefore the aforesaid John craved judgment on him as on a man
convicted. Wherefore it is awarded that the said Roger satisfy him of
the <i>9d.</i> principal, and of his damages, which are pardoned him; and
that for the trespass he be in mercy, <i>6d.</i> Pledge,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And for the greater security of the country the King has commanded that
in the great towns, which are enclosed, the gates be shut from sunset
until sunrise; and that no man lodge in the suburbs, or in any foreign
part of the town save only in the daytime, nor yet in the daytime, if
the host will not answer for him; and that the bailiffs of towns every
week, or at the least every fortnight, make enquiry as to all persons
lodging in the suburbs, and in foreign parts of the towns; and if they
find any who receives or lodges in any manner persons who may be
suspected of being against the peace, the bailiffs shall do right
therein. And it is commanded that from henceforth watches be kept, as
has been used in times past, that is to say, from the day of the
Ascension to the day of St. Michael, in every city by six men at every
gate; in every borough by twelve men; in every town by six men or four,
according to the number of the inhabitants who dwell [in the town], and
that they keep watch continually all night, from sunset to sunrise. And
if any stranger pass by them, he shall be arrested until morning; and if
no suspicion be found, he shall go quit; and if they find cause of
suspicion, he shall be delivered to the sheriff forthwith, and he shall
receive him without danger, and keep him safely, until he be delivered
in due manner. And if they will not suffer themselves to be arrested,
hue and cry shall be levied against them, and those who keep watch shall
follow with all the town, with the towns near, with hue and cry from
town to town, until they be taken and delivered to the sheriff, as
before is said; and for the arrest of such strangers none shall be
called in question.</p>

<p>And further, it is commanded, that highways from one market town to
another be enlarged, where there are woods,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> hedges, or ditches, so that
there be neither ditches, underwood, nor bushes wherein a man may lurk
to do hurt, near the road, within two hundred feet on the one side, and
two hundred feet on the other side, provided that this statute extend
not to oaks, or to great woods, so as it be clear underneath. And if by
default of the lord who will not abate the ditch, underwood, or bushes
in the manner aforesaid, any robberies be done, that the lord be
answerable therefor; and if murder be done, that the lord make fine at
the King's pleasure. And if the lord be not able to clear away the
underwood, that the country aid him in doing it. And the King wills,
that in his demesne lands and woods, within his forest and without, the
roads be enlarged as aforesaid.</p>

<p>And if, perchance, a park be near the highway, it is requisite that the
lord of the park diminish his park, so that there be a space of two
hundred feet from the highway, as before said, or that he make such a
wall, ditch, or hedge, that evil doers will not be able to pass or
return, to do evil.</p>

<p>To the reverend and discreet and their dearest lord, J. de Langton,
chancellor of the illustrious King of England, Robert le Venur, guardian
of the city of Lincoln, and Adam son of Martin of the same city, clerk,
deputed to receive recognisances of debts, greeting. With all reverence
and honour we make known to your reverend discretion by these presents
that Simon le Sage of Scarborough and William Kempe of the same town, of
the county of York, and each of them for the whole sum, acknowledged
before us that they owe to William le Noyr of Lincoln 28<i>s.</i> sterling to
be paid to him or his attorney at the feast of St. Michael in the
twenty-first year of the reign of King Edward, according to the form of
the statute of the said lord the King published at Westminster. And
because the aforesaid Simon and William have not kept the term of their
payment at all, we beseech your reverend discretion humbly and devoutly,
that you will order a writ to be sent to the sheriff of York to compel
the same Simon and William to pay the said money according to the form
of the statute aforesaid. May your reverend discretion prosper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> long and
well. Given at Lincoln on Friday next after the feast of St. Martin in
the year aforesaid.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_209_209" id="Footnote_209_209"></a><a href="#FNanchor_209_209"><span class="label">[209]</span></a> This procedure was first authorised by the Statute of
Acton Burnel (1283), the main provisions of which run as follows:
</p><p>
"Forasmuch as merchants, who before these times have lent their goods to
divers folk, are fallen into poverty, because there was no speedy law
provided whereby they could readily recover their debts at the day fixed
for payment, and for that reason many merchants have ceased to come to
this land with their merchandise to the damage of the merchants and of
the whole realm: the King, by himself and his council ... has ordained
and established that the merchant who will be sure of his debt cause his
debtor to come before the mayor ... and ... to acknowledge the debt and
the day of payment, and that the recognisance be enrolled.... And if the
debtor pay not at the day fixed for him ... the mayor ... shall
forthwith cause the moveables of the debtor to be sold to the amount of
the debt ... and the money to be paid without delay to the creditors....
And if the debtor have no moveables in the power of the mayor from which
the debt can be levied, but have the same elsewhere in the realm, then
the mayor shall send to the Chancellor ... the recognisance made before
him ... and the Chancellor shall send a writ to the sheriff in whose
bailiwick the debtor shall have moveables, and the sheriff shall cause
satisfaction to be made to the creditor.... And if the debtor have no
moveables wherefrom the debt can be levied, then his body shall be
taken, wheresoever he be found, and kept in prison until he have made
satisfaction, or his friends for him."
</p><p>
Two years later (1285) the Statute for Merchants strengthened the
creditor's security by providing that imprisonment should immediately
follow non-payment of the debt.</p></div>

lord Abbot, before William of Stow.</p>

<p>At the command of the lord the King, according to the tenour of the
letter attached to the present roll, the community of London with the
other communities at the fair of St. Ives was summoned to hear the order
of the lord the King according to the new form of this statute touching
merchants frequenting English fairs, and before them the aforesaid
letter was read. And afterwards by the community of the citizens of
London there were elected two of the more discreet and trusty men of the
same city, to wit, Richard Poyntel and William of Paris, to whom in full
court was delivered one of the two seals sent to the keepers of the
fair, enclosed under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> seal of the lord the King and opened in the
presence of the said merchants; and the other seal was delivered in the
same court to one Henry of Leicester, clerk and attorney of Sir John de
Bauquell, to whom the lord the King committed the merchants' seal, as
appears in the letter attached to the present roll:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Edward by the grace of God King of England, lord of Ireland and duke of
Aquitaine, to the keepers of the fair of St. Ives, greeting. Whereas our
beloved clerk, John de Bauquell, citizen of London,&mdash;to whom we have
committed the merchants' seal to be kept, and the office thereof,
according to the form of the statute provided hereon by our council, to
be executed by him or others fit herefor, whom he shall be pleased to
depute hereto, in fairs within our realm during our pleasure,&mdash;has
deputed Henry of Leicester, clerk, under him in our presence to execute
the aforesaid office in his place in the fairs aforesaid: We command you
to admit hereto for this turn the aforesaid Henry in place of the
aforesaid John: We command you also, that by assent of the community of
merchants coming to the same fair you cause to be chosen two lawful
merchants of the city of London, who, after taking oath, shall receive
recognisances according to the form of our aforesaid statute, after the
aforesaid seal, which we are sending to you in a box under our seal, has
been opened in their presence, and one piece thereof delivered to the
same merchants and the other piece to the aforesaid clerk. Witness

admitted by the keepers of the fair of St. Ives to measure woollen
cloths made in England, linen and canvas. And because the charter of the
lord the King touching the fair orders that no bailiff or minister of
the lord the King in any wise interfere with the fair aforesaid or its
appurtenances, whereby the Abbot and Convent of Ramsey and their
bailiffs should be prevented from having administration of all things
pertaining to that fair as well within the town as without for ever,
answer was made to the same Hamo by the steward that he would in no wise
admit him to execute such office, which would be to the disherison and
prejudice of the church of Ramsey and contrary to the liberty specified
in the fair-charter, unless Hamo would come into the court and yield up
his letter patent into the hands of the steward. To which court he came
and of his free will delivered up the aforesaid letter and afterwards
craved special grace; and at the instance of the merchants, his letter
patent having been abandoned and annulled, he is admitted for the

<p>The King to the sheriff of Kent, greeting. Because a great part of the
people and specially of the workmen and servants has now died in this
plague, some, seeing the necessity of lords and the scarcity of
servants, will not serve unless they receive excessive wages, and others
preferring to beg in idleness rather than to seek their livelihood by
labour: we, weighing the grave disadvantages which might arise from the
dearth specially of tillers and workmen, have had deliberation and
treaty hereon with the prelates and nobles and other learned men in
session with us, by whose unanimous counsel we have thought fit to
ordain that every man and woman of our realm of England, of whatsoever
condition, free or servile, able-bodied and under the age of sixty
years, not living by trade nor exercising a certain craft, nor having of
his own whereof he shall be able to live, or land of his own, in the
tilling whereof he shall be able to occupy himself, and not serving
another man, shall be bound to serve him who shall require him, if he be
required to serve in a suitable service, regard being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> had to his rank,
and shall receive only the wages, liveries, hire or salaries which used
to be offered in the places where he should serve in the twentieth year
of our reign of England, or in the five or six common years last
preceding; provided that lords be preferred to others in the bondmen or
tenants of their lands so to be retained in their service; so however
that such lords so retain as many as shall be necessary and not more;
and if such a man or woman, so required to serve, refuse so to do, the
same being proved by two trusty men before the sheriff, bailiff, lord,
or constable of the town where this shall come to pass, he shall be
taken forthwith by them or any of them and sent to the nearest gaol,
there to stay in strait keeping until he find security to serve in the
form aforesaid.</p>

<p>And if a reaper, mower or other workman or servant, of whatsoever rank
or condition he be, retained in the service of any man, withdraw from
the said service without reasonable cause or licence before the end of
the term agreed upon, he shall undergo the penalty of imprisonment, and
none, under the same penalty, shall presume to receive or retain such an
one in his service.</p>

<p>Furthermore no man shall pay or promise to pay to any man more wages,
liveries, hire or salaries than is accustomed, as is aforesaid, nor
shall any man in any wise demand or receive the same, under penalty of
the double of that which shall be so paid, promised, demanded or
received, to go to him who shall feel himself aggrieved hereby; and if
none such will prosecute, it shall go to any one of the people who shall
prosecute; and such prosecution shall be made in the court of the lord
of the place where such a case shall befal; and if the lords of towns or
manors shall presume in any wise to contravene our present ordinance, by
themselves or their ministers, then prosecution shall be made against
them in the form aforesaid in counties, wapentakes and ridings, or other
such courts of ours, at a penalty of threefold of that so paid or
promised by them or their ministers; and if by chance any one shall have
covenanted with any man so to serve for a greater salary before the
present ordinance, the latter shall in no wise be bound by reason of the
said covenant to pay to such a man more than has been customary at other
times; nay, rather, he shall not presume to pay more under the penalty
aforesaid.</p>

<p>Moreover saddlers, skinners, tawyers, shoemakers, tailors,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> smiths,
carpenters, masons, tilers, boatmen, carters and other artificers and
workmen whosoever shall not take for their labour and craft more than
used to be paid to such in the twentieth year and other common years
preceding in the places in which they chance to be employed, as is
aforesaid; and if any shall receive more, he shall be committed to the
nearest gaol in the manner aforesaid.</p>

<p>Moreover butchers, fishermen, hostlers, brewers, bakers, poulterers and
all other sellers of victuals whatsoever shall be bound to sell such
victuals for a reasonable price, regard being had to the price at which
such victuals are sold in the neighbouring places; so that such sellers
have a moderate profit and not excessive, as shall be reasonably
required by the distance of the places wherefrom such victuals are
carried; and if any man sell such victuals otherwise and be convicted
thereof in the form aforesaid, he shall pay the double of that which he
shall receive to him that suffered loss, or, for lack of such, to him
who will prosecute in this behalf; and the mayor and bailiffs of cities
and boroughs, market and other towns, and ports and places by the sea,
shall have power to enquire of all and singular who in any wise
transgress against this ordinance, at the penalty aforesaid to be levied
to the use of those at whose suit such transgressors shall be convicted:
and in case the same mayor and bailiffs shall neglect to execute the
premises and shall be convicted hereof before the justices appointed by
us, then the same mayor and bailiffs shall be compelled by the same
justices to pay to such as suffered loss, or, for lack of him, to any
other prosecuting, threefold the value of the thing so sold, and none
the less shall incur grievous punishment at our hands.</p>

<p>And because many sturdy beggars, so long as they can live by begging for
alms, refuse to labour, living in idleness and sin and sometimes by
thefts and other crimes, no man, under the aforesaid penalty of
imprisonment, shall presume under colour of pity or alms to give
anything to such as shall be able profitably to labour, or to cherish
them in their sloth, that so they may be compelled to labour for the
necessaries of life.</p>

<p>We order you, straitly enjoining upon you, that you cause all and
singular the premises to be publicly proclaimed and kept in the cities,
boroughs and market towns, seaports and other places in your bailiwick
where you deem expedient,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> as well within liberties as without, and due
execution to be made thereof, as is aforesaid; and that in no wise you
omit this, as you love us and the common utility of our realm and will
save yourself harmless. Witness the King at Westminster, the eighteenth
day of June. By the King himself and the whole council.</p>

<p>The like writs are directed to the several sheriffs throughout England.</p>

<p>The King to the venerable father in Christ, W. by the same grace bishop
of Winchester, greeting. Because a great part of the people, etc., as
above, as far as "to labour for the necessaries of life," and then thus:
and therefore we request you that you cause the premises to be
proclaimed in the several churches and other places of your diocese
where you shall deem expedient; commanding rectors, vicars of such
churches, ministers and other your subjects that by salutary warnings
they beseech and persuade their parishioners to labour and to keep the
ordinances aforesaid, as instant necessity demands; and that you
constrain the wage-earning chaplains of your said diocese, who, as is
said, refuse in like manner to serve without excessive salary, and
compel them, under penalty of suspension and interdict, to serve for the
accustomed salary, as is expedient; and that you in no wise omit this as
you love us and the common utility of our said realm. Witness as above.</p>

<p>By the King himself and the whole council.</p>

<p>The like letters of request are directed to the several bishops of
England and to the guardian of the archbishopric of Canterbury, the see
being vacant, under the same date.</p>

<p>The King to his beloved and trusty Walter de Mauny and his fellows, our
justices appointed to hear and determine divers trespasses and certain
other things contained in our commission made to you, in the county of
Northampton, greeting. Whereas lately it was ordained by us and our
council that servants, as well men as women, should be bound to serve
and should receive only the salaries and wages which used to be offered
in the places where they ought to serve in the twentieth year of our
reign over England or the five or six common years next preceding, and
that all and singular such servants, workmen and artificers ... taking
more ... be assessed at the whole additional sum which they shall
receive ... and the whole additional sum so received be levied and
collected from every of them to our use in relief of the singular towns
to which the said artificers, servants and workmen belong, and in aid of
payment of the sums at which the same towns or the men thereof are
assessed for the tenth and fifteenth now current ...: you, nevertheless,
... attempt to cause such excesses of wages, liveries, hires and
salaries ... with the fines made before you ... to be enrolled on your

complaint of the people it has been given us to understand: We ...
command you to compel all and singular artificers, servants and workmen,
as well men as women, of whatsoever condition they be, convicted or
hereafter to be convicted before you of such excessive salaries,
liveries, hires or stipends whatsoever received by them in the aforesaid

<p><i>c.</i> 3. Further it is agreed and assented that all the Statutes of
artificers, labourers, servants and victuallers made as well in the time
of our lord the King that now is as in the time of his noble
grandfather, whom God assoil, not repealed, be straitly holden and kept
and duly executed, and that the said artificers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> labourers, servants
and victuallers be duly judged by the justices of the peace as well at
the suit of the King as of the party, according as the said Statutes
require; and that the mayors, bailiffs, and stewards of lords and
constables of towns duly do their offices touching such artificers,
servants, labourers, and victuallers, and that stocks be in every town
for the punishment of the same servants and labourers, as is ordained in
the Statutes aforesaid. And furthermore it is ordained and assented that
no servant or labourer, be it man or woman, depart at the end of his
term out of the hundred, rape or wapentake where he is dwelling, to
serve or dwell elsewhere, or by colour of going afar on pilgrimage,
unless he carry a letter patent containing the cause of his going and
the time of his return, if he ought to return, under the King's seal
that shall be assigned hereto and delivered into the keeping of some
good man of the hundred or hundreds, rape or wapentake, city and
borough, who shall keep the same according to the discretion of the
justices of the peace, and lawfully make such letters when need be, and
in no other wise on his oath, and that around the said seal be written
the name of the county and across the said seal the name of the said
hundred, rape, wapentake, city or borough; and if any servant or
labourer be found in a city, borough or elsewhere, coming from any
place, wandering without such letter, he shall be taken forthwith by the
said mayors, bailiffs, stewards or constables and put in the stocks and
kept until he have found surety to return to his service or to serve or
labour in the town from which he comes, until he have such letter for
departing with reasonable cause; and be it remembered that a servant or
labourer may freely depart from his service at the end of his term and
serve elsewhere, so that he be in certainty with whom, and have such
letter as above; but it is not the intent of this ordinance that
servants who ride or go on the business of their lords or masters be
comprehended within this ordinance during the time of the same business;
and if any carry such letter which can be found to be forged or false,
he shall go to prison for forty days for the falsity, and further until
he have found surety to return and serve and labour as aforesaid. And
that none receive a servant or labourer going forth from their hundreds,
rape, wapentake, city or borough, without letter testimonial or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> with a
letter, for more than one night, unless it be by reason of illness or
other reasonable cause, or unless he will and can serve and labour there
by the same testimony, on a penalty to be limited by the justices of the
peace; and that as well artificers and craftsmen as servants and
apprentices, who are not of great account and of whose craft or mistery
men have no great need in time of harvest, be forced to serve in harvest
at cutting, gathering and bringing in the corn; and that this statute be
duly executed by mayors, bailiffs, stewards and constables of towns on a
penalty to be limited and adjudged by the said justices of the peace in
their sessions, and that none take above 1<i>d.</i> for making, sealing and
delivering the said letter.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> 4. And furthermore, because servants and labourers will not and for
long time have not been willing to serve and labour without outrageous
and excessive hire and much greater than has been given to such servants
and labourers in any time past, so that for dearth of the said labourers
and servants, husbandmen and tenants of land cannot pay their rents or
hardly live on their lands,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> to the exceeding great damage and loss
as well of the lords as of the whole commons; and also because the wages
of the said labourers and servants have not been put in certainty before
these times; it is agreed and assented that the bailiff for husbandry
take 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a year and his clothing once a year at most, the
master hind 10<i>s.</i>, the carter 10<i>s.</i>, the shepherd 10<i>s.</i>, the ox-herd
6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, the cow-herd 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, the swineherd 6<i>s.</i>, the woman
labourer 6<i>s.</i>, the dairymaid 6<i>s.</i>, the ploughman 7<i>s.</i> at most, and
every other labourer and servant according to his degree, and less in
the country where less is wont to be given, without clothing, bounty
(<i>curtoisie</i>) or other reward by covenant.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> And that no servant of
artificers or victuallers within cities, boroughs or other towns take
more than the labourers and servants above named according to their
estate, without clothing, bounty or other reward by covenant, as is said
above. And if any give or take by covenant more than is specified above,
at the first time that they shall be attainted thereof they shall pay,
as well the givers as the takers, the value of the excess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> so given or
taken, and at the second time of their attainder, double the value of
such excess, and at the third time treble the value of such excess; and
if the taker so attainted have nothing wherewith to pay the said excess,
he shall go to prison for forty days.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> 5. Further it is ordained and assented that he or she who is
employed in labouring at the plough and cart or other labour or service
of husbandry until they be of the age of 12 years shall remain
thenceforward at that labour without being put to a mistery or craft;
and if any covenant or bond of apprentice be made henceforth to the
contrary it shall be holden for nought.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> 6. Further, it is agreed and assented that no servant of husbandry
or labourer or servant of an artificer or victualler carry henceforward
baslard, dagger or sword, on pain of forfeiture of the same, except in
time of war for defence of the realm, and then by survey of the arrayers
for the time being, or when travelling through the country with their
masters or on a message of their masters; but such servants and
labourers shall have bows and arrows and use them on Sundays and feast
days, and entirely forsake games of ball as well hand as foot and the
other games called quoits, dice, casting the stone, skittles and other
such unsuitable games; and that the sheriffs, mayors, bailiffs and
constables have power to arrest and do arrest all the contraveners
hereof and the baslards, daggers and swords aforesaid, and to seize and
keep the said baslards, daggers and swords until the session of the
justices of the peace, and present them before the said justices in
their sessions together with the names of those who carried them. And it
is not the King's intent that prejudice be done to the franchises of
lords touching the forfeitures due to them.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> 7. Further, it is agreed and assented that touching every man who
goes begging and is able to serve or labour, it be done with him as with
him who departs out of hundreds and other places aforesaid without a
letter testimonial, as is said above, excepting people of religion and
hermits approved, having letters testimonial of the ordinaries. And that
beggars unable to serve remain in the cities and towns where they are
dwelling at the time of the proclamation of this Statute;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> and that if
the people of the said cities or towns will not or cannot suffice to
find them, the said beggars withdraw to the other towns within the
hundred, rape or wapentake, or to the towns where they were born, within
forty days after the said proclamation be made, and dwell there
continually for their lives. And that with all those who go on
pilgrimage as beggars and are able to labour it be done as with the said
servants and labourers, if they have not letters testimonial of their
pilgrimage under the seals aforesaid. And that the clerks of the
Universities who go begging thus have letters testimonial of their
chancellor on the same penalty.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> 8. Further, it is ordained and assented that those who feign
themselves to be men that have travelled out of the realm and have been
there imprisoned carry letters testimonial of the captains where they
have dwelt, or of the mayors and bailiffs where they make their landing,
and that the same mayors and bailiffs enquire of such folk where they
have dwelt and with whom and in what place is their dwelling in England;
and that the same mayors and bailiffs make them a letter patent under
the seal of their office testifying the day of their landing and where
they have been, as they have said; and that the said mayors and bailiffs
make them swear to keep their right way to their country, unless they
have a letter patent under the King's great seal to do otherwise. And
that if any such travelled man be found without such letter, it be done
with him as with the servants and labourers aforesaid; and this
ordinance shall be applied to travelled men who go begging through the
country after their landing.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> 9. Further it is ordained and assented that the aforesaid
ordinances of servants and labourers, beggars and vagrants, hold good
and be executed as well in cities and boroughs as in other towns and
places within the realm, as well within franchise as without. And that
the sheriffs, mayors and bailiffs and keepers of gaols shall be bound
and charged to receive the said servants, labourers, beggars and
vagrants, and to detain them in prison in the form aforesaid, without
letting them to mainprise or bail and without taking fee or aught else
from them by themselves or by others, as long as they be thus in prison
or at their entry in or issue from the same prison, on pain of paying
100<i>s.</i> to the King.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p><i>c.</i> 10. Further, it is ordained and assented that in every commission
of the justices of the peace there be assigned only six justices beside
the justices of assize, and that the said six justices hold their
sessions in every quarter of the year at least, and this for three days
if need be, on pain of being punished according to the advice of the
King's council at the suit of every man who will make plaint, and
enquire diligently, among other things touching their offices, if the
said mayors, bailiffs, stewards and constables and also gaolers have
duly made execution of the said ordinances and statutes of servants and
labourers, beggars and vagrants, and punish those who are punishable by
the said penalty of 100<i>s.</i> on the same penalty, and punish at their
discretion those who are found in fault who are not punishable by the
said penalty; and that every of the said justices take for his wages
4<i>s.</i> a day for the time of their said sessions, and their clerk 2<i>s.</i> a
day, from the fines and amercements arising and forthcoming from the
same sessions, by the hands of the sheriffs; and that the lords of
franchises be contributors to the said wages according to the proportion
of their part of the fines and amercements aforesaid; and that no
steward of a lord be assigned in any of the said commissions, and that
no association be made to the said justices of the peace<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> after
their first commission. And it is not the intent of this statute that
the justices of the one Bench and of the other and the serjeants at law,
in case they be named in the said commissions, be bound by force of this
statute to hold the said sessions four times a year as are the other
commissioners, who are continually dwelling in the country, but that
they do it when they can well attend hereto.</p>

<p>Prayen the Commons of this present Parliament that where the common
people of this realm is greatly annoyed because of sudden departing of
servants of husbandry from their masters at the end of their terms
without due warning made unto their said masters, where if such warning
were had they might be purveyed of other servants against the end of
their term, and also because that justices of peace many times by
favour,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> prayer or commandment, set so little and so easy fines upon
such as be convict before them, that many dread not the execution of the
law but greatly are emboldened to offend:</p>

<p>That it like the King our Sovereign Lord to ordain by authority of this
present Parliament that every servant of husbandry purposing to depart
from his master at the end of his term, at the middle of his term or
else before make covenant with another man to serve him for the next
year, if he be in such case as the law will compel him to serve, the
same covenant to be made in the presence of the constables of the towns
where such servants at that time be in service; and that the said
servant and he that shall so make covenant with him, in presence of the
said constables, at the middle of the said term or before, warn the
master of the said servant of the said covenant so newly made, so that
the same master may purvey him another servant against the end of his
term; and if any covenant with any such servant be made in other wise,
or that such warning in manner and form abovesaid be not had, the same
covenant be void, and the said servant be compelled to serve his former
master still for the next year, but if<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> any lawful and reasonable
cause being of later time shall require the contrary; also that the
salaries and wages of servants, labourers and artificers, exceed not the
assessing that followeth, that is to say, the salary of a bailiff of
husbandry by year 23<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> and clothing price of 5<i>s.</i> with meat and
drink; of a chief hind, a carter, a chief shepherd, 20<i>s.</i> and clothing
price of 4<i>s.</i> with meat and drink; a common servant of husbandry 15<i>s.</i>
and clothing price of 40<i>d.</i>; a woman servant 10<i>s.</i> and clothing price
of 4<i>s.</i> with meat and drink; a child within age of 14 years 6<i>s.</i> and
clothing price of 3<i>s.</i> with meat and drink; the same form be observed
of salaries of servants with hostlers, victuallers and artificers in
cities, boroughs, and elsewhere being, and such as less deserve, less to
take, and also in places where less is used to be given, less to be
given hereafter. And that from the feast of Easter unto Michaelmas the
wages of any freemason or master carpenter exceed not by the day 4<i>d.</i>
with meat and drink, and without meat and drink 5&frac12;<i>d.</i>; a master
tiler or slater, rough mason and mean carpenter and other artificers
concerning building, by the day 3<i>d.</i> with meat and drink, and without
meat and drink 4&frac12;<i>d.</i>; and every other labourer by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> day 2<i>d.</i>
with meat and drink, and without meat and drink 3&frac12;<i>d.</i> And from the
feast of Michaelmas unto Easter a freemason and a master carpenter by
the day 3<i>d.</i> with meat and drink, and without meat and drink 4&frac12;<i>d.</i>;
tiler, mean carpenter, rough mason and other artificers aforesaid, by
the day 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> with meat and drink, and without meat and drink 4<i>d.</i>;
and every other workman and labourer by the day 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> with meat and
drink, and without meat and drink 3<i>d.</i>; and who that less deserves, to
take less; provided that the said assessing extend not to labourers in
time of harvest about harvest labour, in which the wages of a mower
exceed not by the day 4<i>d.</i> with meat and drink, and without meat and
drink 6<i>d.</i>; a man reaper or carter 3<i>d.</i> by the day with meat and
drink, and without meat and drink 5<i>d.</i>; a woman labourer and other
labourers in harvest by the day 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> with meat and drink, and
without meat and drink 4&frac12;<i>d.</i>; and such as are worth less, less to
take, and in places where less is used to be taken, less be taken
hereafter; and that no artificer, workman or labourer take anything for
any holiday nor for no workday, except after the rate of the time of the
day in which he labours; and if any person refuse to serve or labour
according to the premises, that every justice of the peace in their
shires have power at every time to call them to examination thereof, and
such as they find defective to commit to prison, there to abide till
they have found surety sufficient to serve and labour in form by law
required; and if any servant, artificer, workman or labourer, do
contrary to the premises or deny his service, occupation or labour, by
reason of no giving wages or salaries contrary to this statute, that he
lose to the party that will sue in this part 20<i>s.</i>; and that the givers
of excessive salaries or wages run in the same pain ...</p>

<p>Further, that the justices of peace assess no fine upon any that shall
be convict before them of things done against any Statute of Labourers
or Artificers or by that cause shall put him in the King's grace,

<p>The King to all to whom, etc., greeting. Know ye that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> whereas before
these times divers damages and grievances in many ways have befallen the
merchants of our realm, not without damage to our progenitors, sometime
Kings of England, and to us, because merchants, as well denizen as
alien, buying wools and woolfells within the realm aforesaid and our
power, have gone at their pleasure with the same wools and fells, to
sell them, to divers places within the lands of Brabant, Flanders and
Artois: We, wishing to prevent such damages and grievances and to
provide as well as we may for the advantage of us and our merchants of
the realm aforesaid, do will and by our council ordain, to endure for
ever, that merchants denizen and alien, buying such wools and fells
within the realm and power aforesaid and wishing to take the same to the
aforesaid lands to sell there, shall take those wools and fells or cause
them to be taken to a fixed staple to be ordained and assigned within
any of the same lands by the mayor and community of the said merchants
of our realm, and to be changed as and when they shall deem expedient,
and not to other places in those lands in any wise: granting to the said
mayor and merchants of our realm aforesaid, for us and our heirs, that
the mayor and council of the same merchants for the time being may
impose upon all merchants, denizen and alien, who shall contravene the
said ordinance and shall be reasonably convicted thereof by the
aforesaid mayor and council of the said merchants, certain money
penalties for those offences, and that such money penalties, whereof we
or our ministers shall be informed by the aforesaid mayor, shall be
levied to our use from the goods and wares of merchants so offending,
wheresoever they shall be found within the realm and power aforesaid, by
our ministers, according to the information aforesaid and the assessment
thereof to be made by the mayor himself, saving always to the said mayor
and merchants that of themselves they may reasonably chastise and punish
offending merchants, if their goods and wares chance to be found in the
staple aforesaid outside our realm and power aforesaid, without
interference or hindrance on the part of us or our heirs or our
ministers whomsoever,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> as they have hitherto been wont to do. In witness

in particular in his Parliament last holden at York debate was raised
touching the establishment of certain places within his realm whereat

full treaty and discussion with divers merchants, citizens and burgesses

be two places established for the said sales and purchases, namely, one
on this side Trent, and another beyond, which places should fulfil the
conditions below-written, that is to say, the places should be strong,
well situated and secure for the repair of foreign merchants and the
safety of their persons and their goods, and there should be ready
access for all manner of merchandise, an exchange good, easy and prompt,
and a good and convenient haven in the same places; and that the law and
usages and franchises, which merchants repairing to the Staple in these
times have had and used, they should use and enjoy henceforth at the
places where they shall be, without being drawn into another law or
another custom; and that the foreigners who shall come to the said
places go not further in the realm nor send privily or openly by any
manner of people to make any purchase of wools elsewhere than at the
places established; and hereby the towns of our said lord which are now
decayed and impoverished will be restored and enriched. If it be
established in the form above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> written, it will befal to the great
profit of our lord the King and of all his realm; principally, by the
security of the persons and goods of merchants and other people of the
realm, whom in these times death, robberies and other damages without
number have in large measure befallen; and also by the increase of the
profit of the change of our lord through the plate and bullion which
shall be brought there; and also by the drawing of all manner of
merchants and their merchandise that shall come there; moreover, owing
to the great treasure of the goods of England that is and remains in the
power of aliens, tort, trespass, robberies, and homicide cannot be
readily redressed nor rightly punished in our parts on this side the sea
for fear of the persons and goods which the aliens have in their
power<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>, whereby they are enriched and emboldened to maintain the
mortal enemies of the King, and comfort them with people, arms and
victuals; and by the ordinance aforesaid the merchants and the people of
our said lord, to whom he can resort when need be, will be enriched, and
the enemies of the King impoverished and all alien merchants in his
subjection, and other profits without number will arise, which we cannot
by any means fully show forth. With regard to money, if it please our
lord, let it not be suffered to be brought from the parts beyond the
sea, save only gold, plate and bullion; and to do away with the
counterfeit money current among the good, wheresoever it be found, let
it be pierced and sent to the change.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

2, m. 8</i>], 1326.</p>

<p>Edward, etc., to the mayor of our city of London, greeting. We command
you, straitly enjoining, that the things below<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> written, ordained by us
and our council for the common profit and relief of the people of all
our realm and power, you cause to be proclaimed and published and
straitly kept and observed in our city aforesaid and everywhere in your
bailiwick.</p>

<p>First, that the staple of the merchants and the merchandise of England,
Ireland and Wales, namely, of wools, hides, woolfells and tin, be holden
in the same lands and nowhere else, and that too in the places below
written, that is to say, at Newcastle upon Tyne, York, Lincoln, Norwich,
London, Winchester, Exeter, and Bristol, for England, Dublin, Drogheda
and Cork, for Ireland, Shrewsbury, Carmarthen and Cardiff, for Wales.
And for the tin of Cornwall, at Lostwithiel and Truro. And for the tin
of Devonshire, at Ashburton, and not elsewhere in England, Ireland or
Wales.</p>

<p>And that all alien people there and not elsewhere in England, Ireland or
Wales, may freely buy and seek wools, hides and fells and other
merchandise, and tin in Ashburton, Lostwithiel and Truro, and not
elsewhere, and when they have bought their merchandise at the said
places and in the form abovesaid and paid their customs, and have
thereon letters sealed with the seal of the cocket<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>, they may carry
the said wools, hides, fells, tin and other merchandise into what land
soever they will, if it be not into a land that is at war or enmity with
us or our realm. And that the merchant strangers be warned hereof.</p>

<p>And that no alien by himself or another privily or openly may buy
elsewhere wools or other merchandise abovesaid except at the said
places, upon forfeiture of the wools or other merchandise abovesaid
which he shall have so bought.</p>

<p>And that the merchants of England, Ireland and Wales, who wish to carry
wools, hides, fells or tin out of the staples to be sold elsewhere, may
not carry them from the staples out of our power until they have
remained fifteen days at any of the staples to sell them, and then they
may go with the said merchandise whither they will, without making or
holding a staple anywhere out of the said lands or within the said lands
elsewhere than at the places abovesaid.</p>

<p>And that all people of England, Ireland and Wales, may sell and buy
wools and all other merchandise anywhere that they will in the said
lands, so that the sale be not made to aliens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> except at the staple. And
that wools, hides, fells and tin be nowhere carried out of the said
lands by aliens or denizens except from the staples aforesaid.</p>

<p>And that the merchants of our power make not among themselves any
conspiracy or compact to lessen the price of wools or other merchandise
abovesaid, or to delay merchant strangers in the purchase or sale of
their merchandise, and that those who shall do so and can be attainted
hereof be heavily punished according to the ordinance of us and of our
good council. And that every man be admitted on our behalf who will sue
to attaint and punish such, and that such suit be made before our Chief
Justices or others whom we will assign hereto and not elsewhere. And
that the merchants and the people of Gascony and of the duchy of
Aquitaine, who now are or for the time shall be of the fealty and
obedience of us or of our son and heir<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>, be holden as denizens and
not as aliens in all these affairs.</p>

<p>And that all merchants, native and strangers, be subject to the law
merchant in all things that touch trafficking at the places of the
staples.</p>

<p>And that no man or woman of a borough or city, nor the commons of the
people outside a borough or city in England, Ireland or Wales, after
Christmas next coming, use cloth of their own buying that shall be
bought after the said feast of Christmas, unless it be cloth made in
England, Ireland or Wales, upon heavy forfeiture and punishment, as we
by our good council will ordain hereon. And be it known that by the
commons in this case shall be understood all people except the King and
Queen, earls and barons, knights and ladies and their children born in
wedlock, archbishops and bishops and other persons and people of Holy
Church, and seculars, who can spend yearly from their rents 40<i>l.</i>
sterling, and this so long as it please us by our good council further
to extend this ordinance and prohibition.</p>

<p>And that every man and woman of England, Ireland and Wales, may make
cloths as long and as short as they shall please.</p>

<p>And that people may have the greater will to work upon the making of
cloth in England, Ireland and Wales, we will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> that all people know that
we shall grant suitable franchises to fullers, weavers, dyers and other
clothworkers who live mainly by this craft, when such franchises be
asked of us.</p>

<p>And that it be granted to the wool-merchants that they have a mayor of
the staples abovesaid.</p>

<p>And that all merchant strangers may have the greater will to come into
our power and may the more safely stay and return, we take them, their
persons and goods, into our protection. And we forbid, upon heavy
forfeiture, that anyone do them wrong or injury in person or goods,
while they be coming, staying or returning, so that if anyone do them
injury contrary to this protection and prohibition, those of the town to
which the evildoers shall belong shall be bound to answer for the
damages or for the persons of the evildoers, and that the mayor or
bailiffs of the town where the shipping is take surety for which they
will answer at their peril from the sailors of the same shipping every
time that they shall go out of the havens, that they will not do evil or
misbehave towards any man contrary to these articles.</p>

<p>In witness whereof we have caused these our letters to be sealed with
our seal. Given at Kenilworth, 1 May.</p>

<p>To the reverend father in God the Bishop of Bath, Chancellor of England.</p>

<p>Meekly beseecheth your servant, Hugh Dyke, that whereas our lord the
King on the second day of December in the fourteenth year of his reign,
considering the great kindness which the said Hugh, William Estfield and
Hammond Sutton did to him, and specially for that they then granted to
lend to our said lord the King the sum of 8,000 marks, and our said lord
the King wishing graciously to favour the same William, Hammond and Hugh
in this behalf, by his letters patent, by the advice and assent of his
council in his Parliament, granted and gave license to the same William,
Hammond and Hugh, that in the sale of their wools at the town of Calais
they should be preferred before all other merchants there to the value
of the sum aforesaid, and that they and every of them, or others in
their name whom the said William, Hammond and Hugh would name hereto,
might freely sell their wools aforesaid to the value aforesaid within
your said town to what person soever and in what manner soever they
should wish, before the other merchants aforesaid, and retain by them
the sums forthcoming thence without any restriction or partition to be
made thereof in the Staple of Calais among the merchants of the same,
any statute or ordinance made to the contrary notwithstanding, as is
more fully contained in the said letters; and although one Thomas
Ketyll, servant to the said Hugh, at the commandment and will of his
master, sold a sarpler of wool to a stranger for the sum of 12<i>l.</i>
5<i>s.</i>, to have and enjoy to him without any restriction or partition to
be made thereof, as parcel of the sum aforesaid, nevertheless Thomas
Thurland of Calais, because the said Thomas Ketyll would not deliver the
said sum of 12<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> to put the same in partition in the Staple, put
him in prison and detained him for a long time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> contrary to the tenour
of the letters aforesaid to the prejudice of our lord the King and the
great damage and loss of the said Hugh and Thomas Ketyll. Wherefore
please it your benign grace to grant a writ of <i>subp&oelig;na</i> directed to
the said Thomas Thurland to appear before you in the Chancery of our
lord the King upon pain of 30<i>l.</i> to answer as well our lord the King as
the said Hugh and Thomas Ketyll touching the premises, and to do right
to the parties, by way of charity.</p>

<p>Edward by the grace of God, King of England, etc., to our well-beloved
Hamon de Chigewelle, Mayor of our city of London, greeting. We have read
the letters that you have sent us, in the which you have signified unto
us that Flemings, Brabanters and other aliens have been suddenly buying
throughout our land all the teasels that they can find; and also are
buying butter, madder, woad, fullers' earth, and all other things which
pertain to the working of cloth, in order that they may disturb the
staple and the common profit of our realm; and further, that you have
stopped twenty tuns that were shipped and ready for going beyond sea, at
the suit of good folks of our said city; upon your doing the which we do
congratulate you, and do command and charge you, that you cause the said
tuns well and safely to be kept; and if any such things come into our
said city from henceforth, to be sent beyond sea by merchants aliens or
denizens, cause them also to be stopped and safely kept, until you shall
have had other mandate from us thereon; and you are not to allow any
such things to pass through your bailiwick, by reason whereof the profit
of our staple may be disturbed. We have also commanded our Chancellor,
that by writs under our Great Seal he shall cause it everywhere to be
forbidden that any such things shall pass from henceforth out of our
realm, in any way whatsoever. Given under our Privy Seal at Saltwood the
21st day of May, in the 19th year of our reign.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
For there is no realm in no manner degree<br />
But they have need to our English commodity;<br />
And the cause thereof I will to you express,<br />
The which is sooth as the gospel of the mass.<br />
<br />
Meat, drink and cloth, to every man's sustenance<br />
They belong all three, without variance.<br />
For whoso lacketh any of these three things,<br />
Be they popes or emperors, or so royal kings,<br />
<br />
It may not stand with them in any prosperity;<br />
For whoso lacketh any of these, he suffereth adversity;<br />
Whiles this is sooth by your wits discern<br />
Of all the realms in the world this beareth the lantern.<br />
<br />
For of every of these three by God's ordinance,<br />
We have sufficiently unto our sustenance,<br />
And with the surplusage of one of these three things<br />
We might rule and govern all Christian kings.<br />
<br />
For the merchants come our wools for to buy<br />
Or else the cloth that is made thereof surely,<br />
Out of divers lands far beyond the sea,<br />
To have this merchandise into their country.<br />
<br />
Therefore let not our wool be sold for nought,<br />
Neither our cloth, for they must be sought;<br />
And in especial restrain straitly the wool,<br />
That the commons of this land may work at the full.<br />
<br />
And if any wool be sold of this land,<br />
Let it be of the worst both to free and bond,<br />
And none other in [no] manner wise,<br />
For many divers causes, as I can devise.<br />
<br />
If the wool be coarse, the cloth is mickle the worse,<br />
Yet into little they put out of purse<br />
As much for carding, spinning and weaving,<br />
Fulling, roving, dyeing and shearing;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span><br />
And yet when such cloth is all ywrought,<br />
To the maker it availeth little or nought,<br />
The price is simple, the cost is never the less,<br />
They that worketh such wool in wit be like an ass.<br />
<br />
For and ye knew the sorrow and heaviness<br />
Of the poor people living in distress,<br />
How they be oppressed in all manner of thing,<br />
In giving them too much weight into the spinning.<br />
<br />
For nine pounds, I ween, they shall take twelve,<br />
This is very truth, as I know myself;<br />
Their wages be bated, their weight is increased,<br />
Thus the spinners' and carders' avails be all ceased.<br />

<p>The King sent his writ to the bailiffs of the abbot of Ramsey of the
fair of St. Ives in these words:&mdash;Edward by the grace of God King of
England, Lord of Ireland and Duke of Aquitaine, to the bailiffs of the
abbot of Ramsey of the fair of St. Ives, greeting. Whereas, on the
frequent complaint of our beloved cousin, Alice countess Marshal,
representing to us that lately by our licence she caused a ship about to
sail to the parts beyond seas to be laden with jewels of gold and silver
and other her goods and chattels to the value of 2000<i>l.</i>, to be taken
thence to the said parts to await her coming there; and that John
Crabbe, master of a ship of The Mew, Miles of Utenham, Christian
Trilling, Crabekyn, nephew of John Crabbe, John Labay and John Winter,
together with certain other evildoers of the parts of Flanders, met the
aforesaid ship so laden on its way towards the said parts on the sea
between Boulogne and Whitsand, and in hostile manner took and carried
away the same ship so laden with cloths, jewels and other goods
aforesaid, and still detain the same jewels and goods of the aforesaid
countess, to her no small damage and loss: we many times requested
Robert, count of Flanders, by our special letters to hear the plaint of
the aforesaid countess on the premises, to be set forth to the same
count<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> by her or her proctor or attorney in this behalf, and thereupon
to cause full justice to be done to her touching the said cloths, jewels
and other goods so carried off; whereupon the same count afterwards
wrote back to us, saying that he had caused certain of the aforesaid
evildoers to be punished, and was ready to hand over the others whom he
might secure to due punishment, as reason should permit. But, because
the aforesaid count delayed to show justice to the said countess
touching the restitution of the cloths, jewels and goods aforesaid
according to the form of our aforesaid requests, we afterwards thought
fit to require him divers times by our special letters to cause due
restitution or suitable satisfaction, as right should require, to be
made to the same countess for the cloths, jewels, goods and chattels
aforesaid. And though the count has received our letters aforesaid and
has been many times requested with great diligence on behalf of the same
countess by her attorneys or proctors to cause full justice to be done
to her in the premises, nevertheless he has neglected to do anything
therein at such our requests, although a great part of the same goods
had come into his hands, but has altogether failed to show her justice,
as the mayor and aldermen of our city of London have made known to us by
their letters patent sealed with their common seal.</p>

<p>We, refusing to refrain longer from causing the aforesaid countess to be
provided with a remedy agreeable to right touching the recovery of her
goods aforesaid, command you that you cause to be arrested without delay
all goods and wares of the men and merchants of the power and lordship
of the said count of Flanders, except the goods and wares of the
burgesses and merchants of Ypres, which shall happen to be found within
your bailiwick, to the value of 200<i>l.</i> in part satisfaction of the said
2000<i>l.</i>, and to be kept under such arrest safely and without detraction
or diminution, until you shall have other orders from us thereon; and
that you make known to us plainly and openly under your seals what goods
and of what sort you cause to be arrested on that account, and whose
they are, and also the value thereof, returning to us this writ. For we
have commanded the mayor and sheriffs of London to cause to be arrested
without delay and to be kept under such arrest, until full satisfaction
be made to the aforesaid countess of her said goods so carried off, the
goods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> and wares of the men and merchants of the power of the said count
within their bailiwick to the value of 1000<i>l.</i>; and the bailiffs of the
town of Great Yarmouth to cause the arrest of goods to the value of
300<i>l.</i>; and the bailiffs of the town of Ipswich to cause the arrest of
goods to the value of 300<i>l.</i>; and the bailiffs of the town of Lynn to
cause the arrest of goods to the value of the 200<i>l.</i> residue. Witness
myself at Westminster on the 24th day of April in the eighth year of our
reign.</p>

<p>To which writ answer was made that no goods or chattels of the power and
lordship of Robert, count of Flanders, were found in the fair of St.
Ives after this writ was delivered to us. Therefore nothing at present
has been done therein.</p>

<p>The King to all to whom, etc., greeting. John Hampshire and Henry May,
gentlemen, have shown to us that, whereas they, with twenty nine
persons, merchants and mariners, our lieges, in the month of December in
the twenty second year of our reign, in a ship called <i>Clement</i> of
Hamble, came out of our duchy of Normandy sailing to our realm of
England, there came upon them thirty mariners of Brittany and took and
carried away the goods and merchandise of the aforesaid John and Henry
and other our lieges aforesaid to the value of 1336 marks, and their
bonds, indentures and bills making mention of debts to the sum of 700
marks, and beyond this likewise took and carried away the whole tackling
of the ship aforesaid and all their victuals found in the same ship, and
inhumanly stripped the same John and Henry to their shirts and certain
of our other said lieges as well of their shirts as of their other
garments, and abandoned and left the said John and Henry and our other
lieges abovesaid in the ship aforesaid, bereft and spoiled of all manner
of tackling necessary and requisite for the safe conduct of the same
ship, in the midst of the sea, in which ship the same John and Henry and
the rest of our lieges aforesaid, labouring in tempest and various
storms of the sea for three days and three nights together, and
despairing of their life in regard to all human aid, and putting all
hope and trust of their salvation wholly in God and the glorious Virgin
Mary, at length, after the days and nights<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> aforesaid were past, they
arrived in port, at least a place of safety, by God's help; and although

requested our cousin the duke of Brittany by letters of our privy seal
that he would cause the same John and Henry to be provided with due and
just restitution to be had in this behalf, yet the same John and Henry,
using all diligence with due and speedy suit made to the same our cousin
in this behalf for three years and more, have not yet obtained and
cannot in any wise obtain any restitution thereof, to the gravest
expense and no small damage and burden to the same John and Henry;
wherefore they have humbly and instantly made supplication to us that we
would graciously deign to provide for relief to be made to them in this
behalf: We, considering that justice is and has been against all
conscience denied or at least delayed to the same John and Henry
diligently suing for their right, and willing to make provision that
justice or at least the execution of justice perish not in this behalf,
as far as in us lies, by the inspiration of piety, therefore, graciously
inclining to the supplication of the same John and Henry most benignly
made to us in this behalf, have granted to the same John and Henry
marque and reprisal, so that they, by themselves or their factors,
attorneys or servants having or to have sufficient power from them, and,
if the same John and Henry perchance die in the meantime, by their heirs
and executors, may take and arrest the bodies, ships, vessels, goods,
wares and merchandise of any subjects soever of the aforesaid duke,
wheresoever they may be found within our realms, lordships, lands,
powers and territories, as well on this side as beyond the sea, by land,
sea or water, within liberties and without, to the value of the said
2036 marks, and lawfully and with impunity detain the same until full
satisfaction shall have been made to them of that sum and of the whole
and entire tackling of the ship aforesaid and of the victuals aforesaid
or of the true value of the same, and of the damages, costs, outlays and
expenses which they have reasonably sustained and will sustain on our
behalf, and, for default of such satisfaction, that they may give, sell,
alienate them and dispose and order thereof as with their own goods, as
it shall seem to them best to be done, without hindrance, disturbance,
vexation or annoyance at the hands of us or our heirs or the officers or
ministers of us or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> our heirs whomsoever. And we give to all and
singular our admirals, captains, castellans and their lieutenants and
deputies, sheriffs, mayors, bailiffs, constables, searchers, wardens of
seaports and other maritime places, masters and mariners of ships and
other places whatsoever, and other our officers, ministers, lieges and
subjects whomsoever, as well on this side as beyond the sea, by land,
sea or water, wheresoever they be stablished, that they be intendant,
counselling, aiding and respondent in the premises to the same John and
Henry or their factors, attorneys, deputies or servants having or to
have sufficient power from the same John and Henry, and, if they die as
is aforesaid, then to their heirs or executors, as often as and when
they be duly requested by the same John and Henry or either of them or
the others aforesaid or any of them on our behalf. In witness, etc.

<p>The King to archbishops, etc. Know ye that we have granted and by this
our charter have confirmed for us and our heirs to our beloved burgesses
and merchants of Douai that for ever throughout the whole of our land
and power they have this liberty, to wit, that they or their goods,
found in any place soever in our power, shall not be arrested for any
debt for which they are not sureties or principal debtors, unless by
chance such debtors be of their commune and power, having goods
wherefrom they can make satisfaction for their debts in whole or in
part, and unless the burgesses of Douai, by whom that town is governed,
fail in justice to those who are of our land and power, and this can be
reasonably ascertained; and that the said burgesses and merchants for
ever be quit of murages on all their goods, possessions and merchandise
throughout our whole realm; and that the burgesses and merchants
aforesaid shall not lose their chattels and goods found in their hands
or deposited elsewhere by their servants, so far as they can
sufficiently prove them to be their own, for the trespass or forfeiture
of their servants; and also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> if the said burgesses and merchants or any
of them die within our land and power testate or intestate, we or our
heirs will not cause their goods to be confiscated so that their heirs
should not entirely have them, so far as the same be proved to be the
chattels of the said deceased, provided that sufficient knowledge or
proof be had touching the said heirs; and that they with their
merchandise may safely come into our land and power and stay there,
paying the due and right customs; so also that if at any time there be
war between the King of the French or others and us or our heirs, they
be forewarned to depart from our realm with their goods within forty
days. Wherefore we will and straitly command, for us and our heirs, that
the aforesaid burgesses and merchants and their heirs for ever have all
the liberties aforewritten throughout the whole of our land and power.
And we forbid, upon our forfeiture of 10<i>l.</i>, that any man presume to
molest or annoy them in aught unjustly contrary to this liberty and our
grant. These witnesses:&mdash;the venerable father H. bishop of London,
Richard de Clare, earl of Gloucester and Hertford, Humphrey de Bohun,
earl of Hereford and Essex, Hugh le Bygod, Philip Basset, Hugh le
Despenser, our justiciar of England, James de Alditheleg, Roger de

of our reign.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>The burgesses and merchants of Douai give the King 100 marks for this
charter, which sum should be allowed in the 90<i>l.</i> in which the King is
bound to them, whereof there is the King's writ of <i>liberate</i> at the
King's Exchequer; and the writ should be searched for and the 100 marks
noted therein.</p>

Court of Wednesday [14 May, 1270].</p>

<p>Gottschalk of Almain, burgess of Lynn, makes plaint of the communities
of Ghent, Poperingen, Douai, Ypres and Lisle, as men of the countess of
Flanders, to wit, that whereas the same Gottschalk caused 14 sacks of
wool worth 140 marks to be brought from the realm of England to Bruges
in Flanders, to trade with it there, and lodged the wool at the house of
one Henry Thurold on Sunday next after Ash Wednesday in the forty-ninth
year of the reign of King Henry, the bailiffs of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> the said countess came
and arrested the said wool against the peace of the realm and still
detain it. Wherefore the same Gottschalk, for the unjust detention of
the wool aforesaid, made petition to the lord the King at Kenilworth and
elsewhere until now; whereupon the lord the King many times directed his
letters to the same countess, asking her to satisfy the same Gottschalk
of the aforesaid wool or the price thereof, and she has hitherto
neglected to do anything for the same Gottschalk, to his damage of 200
marks; and he produces suit. The aforesaid communities, being present,
do not deny the accustomed words of the court<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> or the detention of
the aforesaid wool or the damage of the aforesaid Gottschalk, but craved
licence to consult forthwith on the matter and withdrew. And afterwards
they came, making no defence against the charge of the said Gottschalk,
but the men of Ypres presented a charter of certain liberties granted to
them by the King's Court, stating that they should not be distrained for
any debt unless they were the sureties or principal debtors. For the men
of Lisle there came one Alard of Leeuw and showed a charter of the lord
the King for himself only, stating that he should not be distrained
unless he were a principal debtor or surety. Another man named Peter
Blarie of Lisle says that he has no charter. The men also of the
communities of Ghent and Douai<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> craved respite until Saturday to
show their charters, which they say that they have from the King's
Court, and that day was granted to them. The aforesaid Gottschalk,
however, craved judgment for the default of the aforesaid merchants; and
a day is given to the parties, to wit, to-morrow....</p>

<p>Be it remembered that Gottschalk of Almain, burgess of Lynn, gives to
the lord a seventh part of all which he may recover against the
communities of Ypres, Ghent, Douai, Poperingen and Lisle, to wit, of the
120 marks which he seeks for 14 sacks of wool detained to his damage of
200 marks.</p>

<p>Unto the most honourable Lords, and rightful, the Mayor and Aldermen of
the City of London, humbly pray the Weavers alien working in the same
City, that the points and Ordinances underwritten may be granted and
allowed to them, for the common profit of the land and of the City and
for the saving of their said trade.</p>

<p>In the first place, that three good folks of the weavers alien may be
ordained and sworn to keep and rule their trade, and the points
underwritten.</p>

<p>Also, that if any alien shall come to the said city to work in the said
trade, and to make his profit, he shall do nothing in the same before he
shall have presented himself to the Masters alien of the said trade, and
by the said Masters have been examined if he knows his trade or not; and
thereupon, let orders be given by the said Masters what he shall take by
the day for his work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>Also that no one of the said trade of weavers alien shall be so daring
as to work at the trade by night.</p>

<p>Also, that no one in the said trade shall work at the trade on
Saturdays; or on the Eve of Double Feasts after None rung in the parish
where he resides.</p>

<p>Also, if any workman has served his alien master by the day or by the
week, and the said master will not pay the workman for his work,
according as they shall have agreed, the good folks who shall be
ordained and sworn to keep and rule their said trade, shall have power
to forbid the said master to be so daring as to work at the said trade,
until he shall have paid his workman what he is bound to pay him. And if
he shall do the contrary, and be convicted thereof, let him pay to the
Chamber the penalty that is underwritten.</p>

<p>Also, whereas heretofore, if any dispute occurred between a master alien
in the said trade and his workman, such workman was wont to go to all
the workmen within the City in the said trade, and by covin and
conspiracy between them made, they would give orders that no one of them
should work or submit to serve until the said master and his workman
should have agreed; by reason whereof the masters of the said trade were
in great trouble, and the people left unserved; it is ordered that, from
henceforth if any dispute shall occur between any master alien and his
workman in the said trade, the same dispute shall be rectified by the
Wardens of the trade. And if any workman who shall have offended, or
have misbehaved towards his master alien will not submit to be adjudged
before the said Wardens, let such workman be arrested by a Serjeant of
the Chamber at the suit of the said Wardens, and brought before the
Mayor and Aldermen; and before them let him be punished, at their
discretion.</p>

<p>Also, if any alien of the said trade shall be found doing mischief in
the way of larceny, to the value of 12 pence; the first time, let him
make amends to him against whom he shall have so offended, at the
discretion of the Masters alien of the said trade. And if he shall be
found guilty thereof a second time, let him be brought before the Mayor
and Aldermen, and before them be punished according to his deserts.</p>

<p>Also if any alien of the said trade shall be found guilty in any point
aforesaid, let him be amerced, the first time, in 40 pence, to the use
of the Chamber; half a mark, the second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> time; 20 shillings the third
time; and the fourth time, let him forswear the trade in the said city,
and every time, let him also pay 12 pence to the Wardens for their
trouble.</p>

<p>John le Grutteret and Peter Vanthebrok, Flemings, and John Elias,
Brabanter, were chosen on the 23rd day of February in the 36th year and
sworn to keep and oversee the Articles aforesaid, and the alien men of
the same trade.</p>

orator, Henry Wakyngknyght, goldsmith, tenderly to consider that whereas
he, by the Mayor's commandment of London, caused by the subtle
suggestion of the Wardens of the Craft of Goldsmiths of London, now late
is imprisoned within the Counter in Bread Street, no cause laid against
him but only that he is a stranger born, occupying his craft in London,

him be shewed in this behalf. Wherefore please it your said gracious
lordship, the premises considered, and also the holy time of Easter now

up the body of the said Henry with the cause of his arrest before your

<p>To the right reverend father in God, the Bishop of Lincoln and
Chancellor of England.</p>

<p>Right humbly beseecheth unto your lordship your Orator William Elryngton
of Durham, mercer, that whereas he now 4 years past and more had for a
stock of one Richard Elryngton the sum of 30<i>l.</i>, wherefore your said
Orator was by his obligation bounden unto the said Richard in 40<i>l.</i> and
odd silver; which sum of 30<i>l.</i> your said Orator should have to be
employed in merchandise, during the space of 7 years, yielding yearly
unto the said Richard, for the loan thereof 4<i>l.</i> of lawful money of
England, and at the 7 years' end to yield whole unto the said Richard
the said sum of 30<i>l.</i>; whereupon your said Suppliant occupied the said
sum by the space of 2 years, and paid yearly unto the said Richard
4<i>l.</i>; and after that your said Orator, remembering in his conscience
that that bargain was not godly nor profitable, intended and proffered
the said Richard his said sum of 30<i>l.</i> again, which to do he refused,
but would that your said Orator should perform his bargain.
Nevertheless, the said Richard was afterward caused, and in manner
compelled, by spiritual men to take again the said 30<i>l.</i>, whereupon
before sufficient record the said Richard faithfully promised that the
said obligation of 40<i>l.</i> and covenants should be cancelled and
delivered unto your said Orator, as reason is. Now it is so that the
said Richard oweth and is indebted by his obligation in a great sum of
money to one John Saumpill, which is now Mayor of Newcastle, wherefore
now late the said Richard, by the mean of the said mayor, caused an
action of debt upon the said obligation of 40l. to be affirmed before
the mayor and sheriff of the said Town of Newcastle, and there by the
space almost of 12 months<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> hath sued your said Orator, to his great
cost, and this against all truth and conscience, by the mighty favour of
the said mayor, by cause he would the rather attain unto his duty,
purposeth now by subtle means, to cast and condemn wrongfully your said
Orator in the said sum of 40<i>l.</i>, to his great hurt and undoing, without
your special lordship be unto him shewed in this behalf, wherefore
please it your said lordship to consider the premise, thereupon to grant
a <i>certiorari</i>, direct unto the Mayor and Sheriff of the said Town, to
bring up before you the cause, that it may be there examined and ruled
as conscience requireth, for the love of God and in way of charity.</p>

a great landlord, (<i>b</i>) the payments due to him as feudal overlord, and
(<i>c</i>) the profits of justice and administration, Nos. 1 and 2

the prerogative right of the Crown to payments for the privilege of
commercial intercourse by way of prise or custom; and in the second
place the continuous efforts of medi&aelig;val governments to secure a good
and easy currency (Nos. 7 to 9), a problem which they failed to solve
either by the direct method of forbidding the export and controlling the
import of money, or by the indirect method of insisting on the exchange
of goods for goods by alien merchants frequenting the realm.</p>

10 <i>Edward</i> III, <i>m.</i> 13], 1336.</p>

<p>This is the form which the assessors and taxers of the fifteenth,
granted to our lord the King in his Parliament holden at Westminster on
the Monday next after Sunday in mid-Lent last past, in the tenth year of
his reign, by the earls, barons, freemen and the commonalties of all the
counties of the realm, and also of the tenth there granted to our said
lord the King in all the cities, boroughs and the ancient demesnes of
the King, of the same realm, from all their goods which they had on the
day of the said grant, ought to observe, and thereby to assess, tax,
collect and levy the same fifteenth and tenth in the counties of
Northumberland, Cumberland and Westmoreland, to wit, that the chief
taxers without delay cause to come before them from each city, borough
and other town of the counties, within franchise and without, the more
lawful and wealthier men of the same places in such number that
therefrom the chief taxers may sufficiently choose four or six of each
town, or more if need be, at their discretion, by whom the said taxation
and that which pertains thereto to be done may best be done and
accomplished; and when they shall have chosen such, then they shall
cause them to swear on the Holy Gospels, to wit, those of each town by
themselves, that those so sworn will lawfully and fully enquire what
goods each man of the same towns had on the said day within house and
without, wheresoever they be, without any favour, upon heavy forfeiture,
and will lawfully tax all those goods, wheresoever they have come from
then till now by sale or otherwise, according to the true value, save
the things below excepted in this form, and will cause them to be listed
and put on a roll indented quite fully as speedily as they can, and to
be delivered to the chief taxers one part under their seals, and retain
by themselves the other part under the seals of the chief taxers, and
when the chief taxers shall have in such wise received the indentures of
those who shall be sworn to tax in cities boroughs and other towns, the
same chief taxers shall lawfully and minutely examine such indentures,
and if they discover that there is any defect they shall forthwith amend
it, so that nothing be concealed, neither for gift nor for reward of a
person taxed less than reason requires; and the King wills that the
chief taxers go from hundred to hundred and from town to town, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
need shall be, to survey and enquire that the subtaxers in the same
towns have fully taxed and valued the goods of every man, and if they
find anything concealed, amend it forthwith and cause the Treasurer and
Barons of the Exchequer to know the names of those who shall have so
trespassed, and the manner of their misdeed; and the taxation of the
goods of the subtaxers of the towns shall be made by the chief taxers
and by other good men whom they choose so to do, so that their goods be
well and lawfully taxed in the same manner as those of others. The
taxation of the goods of the chief taxers and of their clerks shall be
reserved to the Treasurer and Barons of the Exchequer. And the chief
taxers, as soon as they shall have received the presentment of the
subtaxers shall cause the fifteenth and tenth to be levied to the use of
the King without delay and without doing favour to any man, in the form
which is enjoined upon them by the commission. And they shall cause to
be made two rolls of the said taxation agreeing in all points, and
retain the one by them to levy the taxation and have the other at the
Exchequer at the feast of St. Peter's Chains next coming, on which day
they shall make their first payment. And be it known that in this
taxation of the goods of the commonalty of all the counties there shall
be excepted armour, mounts, jewels and robes for knights and gentlemen
and their wives, and their vessels of gold and silver and brass, and in
cities and boroughs shall be excepted a robe for the man and another for
his wife and a bed for both, a ring and a buckle of gold or silver, and
a girdle of silk, which they use every day, and also a bowl of silver or
of mazer from which they drink. And the goods of lepers, where they are
governed by a superior who is a leper, shall not be taxed or taken, and
if the lepers be governed by a sound master, their goods shall be taxed
like those of others. And be it remembered that from people of counties
out of cities, boroughs and the king's demesnes whose goods in all
exceed not the value of 10s., nothing shall be demanded or levied; and
from the goods of people of cities, boroughs and the king's demesnes,
which exceed not the value of 6<i>s.</i> in all, nothing shall be demanded or
levied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

to serve our lord the King on the sea for a quarter of a year, the said
quarter beginning on Michaelmas Day next or within fifteen days after,
as he shall deem best to be done, by the testimony of the mayor of
Dartmouth or the admiral's lieutenant in those parts, taking from the
commencement of the said voyage 20<i>s.</i> for each man for the said
quarter, together with all the profit that he may seize from enemies in
the mean time without impeachment, according to the form ordained and
agreed upon in the said Parliament, to be on the sea for the
preservation of English shipping according to their power, without
making for the land of England unless it be through tempest of the sea
or other reasonable cause during the said quarter; for the good and
lawful performance of which voyage in the manner abovesaid the said
William hereby binds himself, his heirs and executors, and all his goods
and chattels, moveable and immoveable, to our said lord the King to
perform the said voyage as is abovesaid; and the survey of the number of
the said men, according to the form of this indenture, shall be made and
witnessed by the admiral in those parts or his lieutenant. In witness
whereof to these indentures the parties aforesaid have interchangeably
put their seals. Written at Exeter, 24 August in the sixth year of the
reign of King Richard the Second after the Conquest.</p>

<p>The King to his beloved clerk, Roger de Northburgh, keeper of his
wardrobe, greeting. Whereas we lately confirmed certain ordinances made
of late by the prelates and chiefs of our realm, and commanded the same
to be observed in all and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> singular their articles, and in those
ordinances it is contained that all gifts and grants made by us to our
loss and to the diminution of our crown after 16 March in the third year
of our reign, on which day we made our commission to the aforesaid
prelates and chiefs touching the making of the said ordinances, ... be
wholly revoked, and afterwards we granted to Stephen de Abindon, our
butler, our right prise of wines one tun of wine before the mast and one
tun of wine behind the mast, at our will, he paying to the merchants
from whom he should receive those wines in our name 20<i>s.</i> for each
piece and 20<i>s.</i> to us for each piece in our wardrobe; which grant was
made after the said 16 March, and is known to redound to our damage: We,
wishing the said ordinances to be duly put into execution in this
behalf, command you that you fully charge Stephen, in his account of the
things pertaining to his office of butler to be rendered before you,
with the wines of our right prise aforesaid for the whole time in which
the same Stephen was our butler, notwithstanding our grant aforesaid and
our commands afterwards following hereon. Witness the King at Odiham, 23
May<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_246_246" id="Footnote_246_246"></a><a href="#FNanchor_246_246"><span class="label">[246]</span></a> The prise of wines was the royal right, limited at least
from the time of Edward I., of purchasing 2 tuns of wine from every ship
at the rate of 20<i>s.</i> a tun, whatever the market price might be; 60<i>s.</i>
a tun was a normal price in the 14th century (<i>see K.R. Accounts</i>, 77.

<p>For the new custom which is granted by all the great men of the realm
and at the prayer of the communities of the merchants of all England, it
is provided that in every county in the largest town where there is a
port two of the more lawful and able men be elected, who shall have one
piece of a seal in keeping, and one man who shall be assigned by that
King shall have another piece; and they shall be sworn that they will
lawfully receive and answer for the King's money, that is to say, on
each sack of wool &frac12; mark, and on each 300 fells which make a sack &frac12;
mark, and on each last<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> of hides 1 mark, that shall go out of the
realm, as well in Ireland and Wales as in England, within the franchise
and without.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> Furthermore in every port whence ships can sail there
shall be two good men sworn that they will not suffer wools, fells or
hides to leave without letters patent sealed with the seal which shall
be at the chief port in the same county; and if there is any man who
goes otherwise therewith out of the realm, he shall lose all the
chattels which he has and his body shall be at the King's will. And
forasmuch as this business cannot be performed immediately, it is
provided that the King send his letters to every sheriff throughout all
the realm, and cause it to be proclaimed and forbidden through all the
counties that any man, upon forfeiture of his body and of all his
chattels, cause wools, fells or hides to be taken out of the land before
the feast of Trinity this year, and thereafter by letters patent sealed
with the seals as is aforesaid, and not otherwise, upon the aforesaid
forfeitures. And the King has granted of his grace that all lordships,
through the ports whereof wools or hides shall pass, shall have the
forfeitures when they are incurred, each in its port, saving to the King
&frac12; mark on each sack of wool and fells, and 1 mark on each last of
hides.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

1302</p>

<p>The King to Archbishops, etc., greeting. Touching the prosperous estate
of the merchants of our duchy aforesaid [Aquitaine] a special care
weighs upon us, in what wise under our lordship the immunity of
tranquillity and full security may be secured to the same merchants for
times to come; so, therefore, that their desires may be the more
abundantly increased to the service of us and our realm, we, favourably
inclining to their petitions, for the fuller assurance of their estate,
have deemed fit to ordain and to grant to the same merchants for us and
our heirs for ever in the form that follows:</p>

<p>First, that all merchant vintners of the duchy aforesaid, safely and
securely, under our defence and protection, may come into our said realm
of England and everywhere within our power with wines and other
merchandise whatsoever and that within the same our realm and power, in
cities,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> boroughs and market-towns, they may traffic in gross<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> as
well with denizens or inhabitants of the same realm as with aliens,
strangers or friends (<i>privatis</i>), and that they may take or carry
whither they will, as well within our realm and power aforesaid as also
without, their merchandise which they shall happen to bring into the
same our realm and power or to buy or otherwise acquire within the same
our realm and power, and to do their will therewith, paying the customs
which they shall owe, except only wines, which it shall not be lawful
for them in any wise to take out of the same our realm and power without
our will.</p>

<p>Further, that the said merchant vintners of the said duchy may lodge at
their will in the cities and towns aforesaid, and stay with their goods
at the pleasure of those to whom the inns or houses belong.</p>

<p>Further, that every contract entered upon by the same vintners with any
persons, whencesoever they be, touching all manner of merchandise, be
valid and stable, so that neither of the merchants may disown that
contract or withdraw from the same, after God's penny<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> shall have
been given and received between the contractors. And if by chance a
dispute arise on such a contract, proof shall be made thereof according
to the uses and customs of the fairs and towns where the said contract
shall happen to be made and entered upon.</p>

<p>Further, we remit and quit to the said merchants of the said duchy that
ancient prise of two tuns of wine which we used to take from every ship
laden with wines touching within our realm or power, one, to wit, before
the mast, and the other behind, promising further and granting to the
same merchants for us and our heirs for ever that we will in no wise
hereafter against the will of the same merchants make or suffer to be
made the aforesaid prise or any other of wines or other their wares by
us or another or others for any necessity or chance, without payment to
be made forthwith according to the price at which the said merchants
will sell wines and other wares to others, or other satisfaction
wherewith they shall count themselves content, so that a valuation or
estimation be not put upon their wines or other wares by us or our
ministers.</p>

<p>Further, that on each tun of wine gauged, as the seller of the wine
shall be bound to supply that which it lacks from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> gauge, so he
shall be satisfied by the buyer of that which is over the gauge
according to the price at which the tun of wine shall be sold.</p>

<p>Further, that as soon as ships with new wines touch within our realm and
power, old wines, wheresoever they be found in towns or other places to
which the said ships shall come, shall be viewed and proved, if they be
whole and also uncorrupt, and of those who shall view the said wines,
one moiety shall be of merchant vintners of the duchy aforesaid, and the
other of good men of the town where this shall be done, and they shall
be sworn to do the premises faithfully and without fraud, and they shall
do the accustomed justice with corrupt wines.</p>

<p>Further, whereas it was of old time accustomed and used that the buyer
and seller should pay 1<i>d.</i> for each tun for gauge, each of them, to
wit, &frac12;<i>d.</i>, let it be so done hereafter and observed for a custom.</p>

<p>Further, we will that all bailiffs and ministers of fairs, cities,
boroughs and market-towns, do speedy justice to the vintners aforesaid
who complain before them of wrongs, molestations done to them, debts and
any other pleas, from day to day without delay according to the Law
Merchant, and if by chance default be found in any of the bailiffs or
ministers aforesaid, whereby the same vintners or any of them shall
sustain the inconveniences of delay, although the vintner recover his
damages against the party in principal, nevertheless the bailiff or
other minister shall be punished by us as his guilt demands, and that
punishment we grant by favour to the merchant vintners aforesaid to
hasten justice for them.</p>

<p>Further, that in all sorts of pleas, saving the case of a crime for
which the penalty of death is inflicted, where a merchant vintner of the
duchy aforesaid shall be impleaded or shall implead another, of
whatsoever condition he who is impleaded shall be, stranger or native,
in fairs, cities, or boroughs where there shall be a sufficient number
of merchant vintners of the duchy aforesaid, and inquest should be made,
one moiety of the inquest shall be of such merchant vintners of the
duchy aforesaid, and the other moiety of other good and lawful men of
that place where that plea shall happen to be, and if it shall happen
that a sufficient number of merchant vintners of the duchy aforesaid be
not found, there shall be put on the inquest those who shall be found
there sufficient of themselves, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> the residue shall be of other good
and sufficient men of the places in which that plea shall be.</p>

<p>Further, that no other exaction or charge of prest shall be in any wise
put upon the wines of the said merchants.</p>

<p>Further, we have deemed fit to ordain, and we will that ordinance for us
and our heirs for ever to be straitly observed, that for any liberty
soever which we or our heirs shall grant hereafter, the aforesaid
merchant vintners shall not lose the above written liberties or any of
them; willing that those liberties extend only to the said merchant
vintners of our duchy aforesaid. But for the abovesaid liberties and
free customs the merchant vintners aforesaid have granted to us that on
each tun of wine which they shall bring or cause to be brought within
our realm or power, and whereon they shall be bound to pay freight to
mariners, they shall pay by name of custom to us and our heirs, beyond
the ancient customs due and paid in money whether to us or to others,
2<i>s.</i> within forty days after the same wines be put ashore out of the
ships. And we will that the aforesaid merchant vintners, in respect of
wines whereon they shall have paid to us the aforesaid custom of 2<i>s.</i>
in one place of our realm or elsewhere within our power, shall be
entirely free and quit of payment of the aforesaid custom of 2<i>s.</i> in
all other places of our said realm and power; provided that for other
merchandise whatsoever which they shall happen to employ within our
realm and power they be held to pay to us the same customs which the
rest of the merchants shall pay to us for such merchandise. These

<p>Edward by the grace of God King of England, Lord of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> Ireland and Duke of
Aquitaine, to archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, earls, barons,
justices, sheriffs, reeves, ministers, and all his bailiffs and
faithful, greeting. Touching the good estate of all merchants of the
underwritten realms, lands and provinces, to wit, Almain, France, Spain,
Portugal, Navarre, Lombardy, Tuscany, Provence, Catalonia, our duchy of
Aquitaine, Toulouse, Quercy, Flanders, Brabant, and all other foreign
lands and places, by whatsoever name they be known, coming to our realm
of England and staying there, an especial anxiety weighs upon us, in
what wise under our lordship a means of tranquillity and full security
may be devised for the same merchants for times to come: in order
therefore that their desires may be rendered apter to the service of us
and our realm, we, favourably inclining to their petitions, for the
fuller assurance of their estate, have deemed fit to ordain and to grant
to the said merchants for us and our heirs for ever as follows: First,
to wit, that all merchants of the said realms and lands, safely and
securely, under our defence and protection, may come into our said realm
of England and everywhere else within our power with their merchandise
whatsoever free and quit of murage, pontage and pavage,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> and that
within the same our realm and power in cities, boroughs and market-towns
they may traffic in gross only<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> as well with denizens or inhabitants
of the same our realm and power aforesaid as with aliens, strangers or
friends (<i>privatis</i>), so nevertheless that the wares which are commonly
called mercery and spices may be sold at retail as before was wont to be
done, and that all the aforesaid merchants may cause their merchandise,
which they chance to bring to our aforesaid realm and power or to buy or
otherwise acquire within the same our realm and power, to be taken or
carried whither they will as well within our realm and power aforesaid
as without, except to lands of manifest and notorious enemies of our
realm, paying the customs which they shall owe, wines only excepted,
which it shall not be lawful for them in any wise to take away from the
same our realm or power after they shall have been brought within the
same our realm or power, without our will and special license.</p>

<p>Further, that the aforesaid merchants may lodge at their will in the
cities, boroughs and town aforesaid, and stay with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> their goods at the
pleasure of those to whom the inns or houses belong.</p>

<p>Further, that every contract entered upon by those merchants with any
persons soever, whencesoever they be, touching any sort of merchandise,
shall be valid and stable, so that neither of the merchants can withdraw
or retire from that contract after God's penny shall have been given and
received between the principal contracting persons; and if by chance a
dispute arise on such a contract, proof or inquisition shall be made
thereof according to the uses and customs of the fairs and towns where
the said contract shall happen to be made and entered upon.</p>

<p>Further, we promise to the aforesaid merchants for us and our heirs for
ever, granting that we will in no wise make or suffer to be made
henceforth any prise or arrest or delay on account of prise of their
wares, merchandise or other goods by us or another or others for any
necessity or case against the will of the same merchants, save upon
immediate payment of the price for which the merchants can sell such
wares to others, or upon satisfaction otherwise made to them, so that
they hold themselves contented; and that no valuation or estimation be
set by us or our ministers on their wares, merchandise or goods.</p>

<p>Further, we will that all bailiffs and ministers of fairs, cities,
boroughs and market-towns do speedy justice to the merchants aforesaid
who complain before them from day to day without delay according to the
Law Merchant touching all and singular plaints which can be determined
by the same law; and if by chance default be found in any of the
bailiffs or ministers aforesaid whereby the same merchants or any of
them shall sustain the inconveniences of delay, although the merchant
recover his damages in principal against the party, nevertheless the
bailiff or other minister shall be punished in respect of us as the
guilt demands, and that punishment we have granted by way of favour to
the merchants aforesaid to hasten justice for them.</p>

<p>Further, that in all sorts of pleas, saving the ease of crime for which
the penalty of death shall be inflicted, where a merchant shall be
impleaded or shall implead another, of whatsoever condition he who is
impleaded shall be, stranger or native, in fairs, cities, or boroughs,
where there shall be a sufficient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> number of merchants of the aforesaid
lands, and inquest should be made, one moiety of the inquest shall be of
the same merchants, and the other moiety of other good and lawful men of
that place where that plea shall happen to be, and if a sufficient
number of merchants of the said lands be not found, there shall be put
on the inquest those who shall be found there fit, and the residue shall
be of other men good and fit of the places in which that plea shall be.</p>

<p>Further, we will, ordain and decree that in each markettown and fair of
our realm aforesaid and elsewhere within our power our weight be set in
a certain place, and before weighing the scales shall be seen to be
empty in the presence of buyer and seller, and that the arms be level,
and that then the weigher weigh level, and when he have put the scales
on a level, forthwith move his hands away, so that it remain level; and
that throughout our whole realm and power there be one weight and one
measure, and that they be marked with the mark of our standard, and that
each man may have scales of a quarter and less, where it shall not be
against the lord of the place or a liberty granted by us or our
ancestors, or against the custom of towns or fairs hitherto observed.</p>

<p>Further, we will and grant that a certain loyal and discreet man
resident in London be assigned as justice for the said merchants, before
whom they may specially plead and speedily recover their debts, if the
sheriffs and mayors do not full and speedy justice for them from day to
day, and that a commission be made thereon granted out of the present
charter to the merchants aforesaid, to wit, of the things which shall be
tried between merchants and merchants according to the Law Merchant.</p>

<p>Further, we ordain and decree, and for us and our heirs for ever we will
that that ordinance and decree be straitly observed, that for each
liberty which we or our heirs shall hereafter grant, the aforesaid
merchants shall not lose the above written liberties or any of them. But
for the obtaining of the aforesaid liberties and free customs and the
remission of our prises to them, the said merchants, all and singular,
for them and all others of their parts, have granted to us with one
heart and mind that on each tun of wine which they shall bring or cause
to be brought within our realm or power, whereon they shall be bound to
pay freight to the mariners, they shall pay to us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> and our heirs by name
of custom 2<i>s.</i> beyond the ancient customs due and accustomed to be paid
in money to us or others within forty days after the said wines be put
ashore out of the ships; further, on each sack of wool which the said
merchants or others in their name shall buy and take or cause to be
bought and taken from our realm, they shall pay 40<i>d.</i> of increment
beyond the ancient custom of half a mark which had before been paid; and
for a last of hides to be carried out of our realm and power half a mark
above that which before was paid of ancient custom; and likewise on 300
woolfells to be taken out of our realm and power 40<i>d.</i> beyond the xed
sum which had before been given of ancient custom; further, 2<i>s.</i> on
each scarlet and cloth dyed in grain; further, 18<i>d.</i> on each cloth
wherein part of the grain is intermixed; further, 12<i>d.</i> on each other
cloth without grain; further, 12<i>d.</i> on each quintal of wax.</p>

<p>And whereas some of the aforesaid merchants deal in other merchandise as
avoir-du-pois and other fine goods, such as cloths of Tars, silk,
cendals and other diverse wares, and horses also and other animals, corn
and other goods and merchandise which cannot easily be put at a fixed
custom, the same merchants have granted to give us and our heirs on each
pound of silver of the estimation or value of such goods and
merchandise, by what name soever they be known, 3<i>d.</i> in the pound at
the entry of those goods and merchandise into our realm and power
aforesaid within fifteen days after such goods and merchandise shall
have been brought into our realm and power and there unladen or sold;
and likewise 3<i>d.</i> on each pound of silver at the export of any such
goods and merchandise bought in our realm and power aforesaid, beyond
the ancient customs before given to us or others; and touching the value
and estimation of such goods and merchandise whereon 3<i>d.</i> on each pound
of silver, as is aforesaid, are to be paid, credit shall be given to
them by the letters which they shall show from their lords or fellows,
and if they have no letters, it shall stand in this behalf by the oaths
of the merchants, if they be present, or of their yeomen in the absence
of the same merchants. It shall be lawful, moreover, for the fellows of
the fellowship of the merchants aforesaid to sell wools within our realm
and power aforesaid to other their fellows, and likewise to buy from the
same without payment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> of custom, so, nevertheless, that the said wools
come not to such hands that we be defrauded of the custom due to us.</p>

<p>And furthermore it is to be known that after the said merchants shall
have once paid in the form aforesaid in one place within our realm and
power the custom above granted to us for their merchandise, and have
their warrant thereof, they shall be free and quit in all other places
within our realm and power aforesaid of payment of such custom for the
same merchandise or wares by the same warrant, whether such merchandise
remain within our realm and power or be carried without, except wines
which shall in no wise be taken out of our realm and power aforesaid
without our will and license, as is aforesaid. And we will, and for us
and our heirs we grant that no exaction, prise or prest or any other
charge be in any wise imposed on the persons of the merchants aforesaid,
their merchandise or goods, against the form expressed and granted
above. These witnesses:&mdash;the venerable fathers, Robert, archbishop of
Canterbury, primate of all England, Walter, bishop of Coventry and
Lichfield, Henry de Lacy, earl of Lincoln, Humphrey de Bohun, earl of
Hereford and Essex and constable of England, Aymer de Valencia, Geoffrey
de Geynvill, Hugh le Despenser, Walter de Bello Campo, steward of our
household, Robert de Bures and others. Given by our hand at Windsor, 1
February in the 31st year of our reign.</p>

<p>To the most excellent lord, the lord prince Edward, by the grace of God
King of England, Lord of Ireland, Duke of Aquitaine, his humble and
devoted mayor and bailiffs of the town of Southampton, obedience,
reverence and honour. We have received your command in these words:</p>

<p>Edward, by the grace of God, King of England, Lord of Ireland and Duke
of Aquitaine, to his mayor and bailiffs of Southampton, greeting.
Because we have learnt by an inquisition which we lately caused to be
made by our beloved and trusty Robert de Glamorgan and John de la Lee,
that Pelegrin de Castello, our merchant of Bayonne, wished to take the
24<i>l.</i>&mdash;which you, believing that he wished to carry the same to parts
beyond the sea against our prohibition that no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> man should carry any
money or silver in bullion out of our realm, arrested on that account in
a ship in our port of Southampton,&mdash;to the parts of Devon and Cornwall
to buy there lead and tin and other merchandise, and not to parts beyond
the sea against the prohibition aforesaid, as you charged against him:
We command you, as we have before commanded, that, if the aforesaid
24<i>l.</i> have been arrested for the cause aforesaid and no other, then you
cause the same to be delivered without delay to the aforesaid Pelegrin,
or that you signify to us the cause wherefor you have refused or were
unable to execute our command before directed to you thereon.</p>

<p>Wherefore we signify to you that the searchers of the town of
Southampton aforesaid, by your writ of the wardrobe sealed with your
privy seal directed to the said searchers on 7 January commanding the
said 24<i>l.</i> to be brought to Odiham and delivered there into your said
wardrobe [paid and delivered the same], of which payment and delivery of
the said 24<i>l.</i> so made the aforesaid searchers have a due acquittance
of receipt. And by the tenour of these presents we signify that for no
other cause were the aforesaid 24<i>l.</i> arrested, save only in the form
aforesaid. In witness whereof we transmit to you these our letters
sealed with our seal. Given at Southampton, 9 March.</p>

<p>Wherefore the same Pelegrin sues for a writ of the lord the King to be
directed to the keeper of the wardrobe of the lord the King, for
satisfaction to be made to him according to the form of the return of
the writ.</p>

10</i>], 1335.</p>

<p>The King to the sheriff of York, greeting. Forasmuch as we have heard
that many folk beyond the sea strive to counterfeit our good money, the
sterling of England, with worse money, and to send this bad money into
our realm, to the deception of us and the damage and oppression of our
people if a remedy be not set thereto; we, willing to prevent such
damages and oppressions, and to provide a suitable remedy hereon and
that our said good money may be multiplied within our realm and the
lands of our power, to the profit of us and our subjects, by assent of
the prelates, earls and barons of our said realm assembled in our
Parliament holden at York on the morrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> of the Ascension last past,
have ordained and established the things that ensue in the manner
underwritten:&mdash;</p>

<p>First, it is provided that no man of religion or other henceforth carry
the sterling out of the realm of England, nor silver in plate, nor
vessels of gold or silver, on pain of forfeiture of the money, plate or
vessel that he shall carry, without special licence from us.</p>

<p>Further, that no false money nor counterfeit sterling be brought into
the realm or elsewhere in our power, on pain of forfeiture of the money;
so always that all folk of what realms or power soever they be, may
safely bring to the exchanges for bullion and not elsewhere silver in
plate, vessels of silver and all manner of moneys of silver, of what
value soever they be, save false money and counterfeit sterling, and
there receive good and suitable exchange.</p>

<p>And that no sterling halfpenny or farthing be molten to make a vessel or
other thing by goldsmiths or others on pain of forfeiture of the money
so molten, and that the goldsmith or other who shall have so molten it,
be put in prison and there stay until he shall have rendered to us the
moiety of that which he shall have so molten, notwithstanding charter or
franchise granted or used to the contrary.</p>

<p>And that all manner of black money now commonly current in our realm and
power be utterly excluded, so that none be current after the month next
after proclamation be made, on pain of forfeiture of the same money.</p>

<p>And that every man who will sue for us against such as shall commit
fraud against this ordinance be admitted hereto and have the fourth
penny of that which shall be so deraigned at his suit to our profit.</p>

<p>And that the mayor or bailiffs in every port where merchants and ships
are take oath of the merchants and masters of ships going and returning
that they will commit no fraud against this ordinance in any point.</p>

<p>And that there be a table of exchange at Dover and elsewhere where and
when it shall seem good to us and our council to make exchanges. And
that the wardens of the said tables make exchanges by testimony of the
controllers whom we will appoint there.</p>

<p>And that no pilgrim pass out of our realm to the parts beyond the sea
except at Dover, on pain of imprisonment for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> a year. And that good ward
and strict be made in all places on the seacoast in ports and elsewhere
where there is any manner of landing, by good and lawful men sworn, who
in our name shall cause diligent search to be made that none, of what
condition or estate soever he be, take sterling money, silver in plate,
or vessel of gold or silver out of our realm without our licence, nor
bring into the said realm or power false money or counterfeit sterling,
as is aforesaid, on the pains and forfeitures aforesaid. And the money,
vessel or plate so forfeited shall be delivered at our exchanges by
indenture, whereof the one part remaining with the searchers shall be
delivered at the Exchequer, and by the same indentures the warden of the
exchanges shall be charged with that which he shall have received.</p>

<p>And that the searchers have of our gift for all their work the fourth
penny of as much as they find so forfeited. And if the searchers make
release or show favour to any and be attainted hereof they shall be
liable to forfeiture of as much as they shall have in goods; and that
the hostlers in every port where there is passage shall be sworn to make
search upon their guests in like manner as the searchers shall do, and
shall have the fourth penny of that which they find forfeit to us, as
the said searchers shall have. And it is our intention that the said
searchers have power to search the hostels and to inform themselves of
the doings of hostlers; and that the hostlers, in case they be found
deceitful against the said articles, shall be punished and incur the
forfeiture aforesaid.</p>

<p>Wherefore we command you, straitly enjoining, that forthwith upon sight
of these letters you cause all the articles and points aforesaid to be
cried and published in cities and boroughs, market towns, ports and all
other places within your bailiwick, as well within franchise as without,
where you shall see fit so to do; and that in all other places within
your bailiwick where need shall be, except the places where such wardens
and searchers shall be deputed by us, you cause such searchers and
wardens to be established and sworn to keep and observe this our
ordinance in the form aforesaid, on the pains contained in this form;
and that you certify the Treasurer and Barons of our Exchequer without
delay of the names of those who shall be hereafter assigned by you as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
searchers and wardens. Given under our great seal at York, 6th June in
the 9th year of our reign.</p>

<p>In like manner command is given to the several sheriffs throughout
England....</p>

<p><i>The oath of the searchers.</i>&mdash;You shall swear that you will well and
lawfully make search of all the things contained in your commission
whereof search ought to be made according to the commission, and that
you will lawfully perform all the other things contained in the same,
and that you will lawfully charge yourself with that which you shall
find forfeited to the King and will make a lawful indenture thereof and
render a lawful account, and that you will spare none for love or for
favour, to have private gain, whereby the King may be a loser. So help
you God and his saints.</p>


<p>9. <span class="smcap"><a name="Opinions_of_Officers_of_the_Mint_on_the_State_of_English" id="Opinions_of_Officers_of_the_Mint_on_the_State_of_English"></a>Opinions of Officers of the Mint on the State of English
Money</span> [<i>Rot. Parl., III.</i>, 126-7], 1381-2.</p>

<p>To our lord the King and to all the lords and commons of his realm, make
known, as they have often done before these times without being heard,
the officers over the moneys of the Tower of London, how for lack of
good ordinance no gold or silver comes into England, but of that which
is in England a great part has been and from day to day is carried out
of the land, and that which remains in England by fault of the deceit of
clippers and otherwise is become right feeble, and from day to day such
damage increases. Wherefore please it you to take good counsel and
remedy hereon, otherwise we, the said officers, warn you, and before God
and before you we will be excused, that if you do not apply a speedy
remedy thereto in short time to come, where you think to have 5<i>s.</i> you
will not have 4<i>s.</i></p>

<p><i>Richard Leicester.</i>&mdash;First, as to this that no gold or silver comes
into England, but that which is in England is carried beyond the sea, I
maintain that it is because the land spends too much in merchandise, as
in grocery, mercery and peltry, or wines, red, white and sweet, and also
in exchanges made to the Court of Rome in divers ways. Wherefore the
remedy seems to me to be that each merchant bringing merchandise into
England take out of the commodities of the land as much as his
merchandise aforesaid shall amount to; and that none<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> carry gold or
silver beyond the sea, as it is ordained by statute. And let a good
ordinance be made hereof, as well by search as otherwise. And so meseems
that the money that is in England will remain, and great quantity of
money and bullion will come from the parts beyond the sea.</p>

<p>As to this, that the gold is right feeble because of clipping, there
seems to me no other remedy than that gold be generally weighed by those
who shall take it; and hereon let proclamation be made, and this will be
a smaller loss than to change the money, as may be more fully declared.</p>

<p>As to this, that there is a great lack of halfpence and farthings, the
Master is bound by his indenture to make halfpence according to the
quantity of his work of silver. Let the Warden of the Mint be charged to
survey that the Master of the Mint do in all points that which
appertains to his office.</p>

<p>As to this, that the gold agrees not with the silver, it cannot be
amended unless the money be changed. And to change the money in any
manner seems to me universal damage to the lords, commons and all the
realm, as may be more fully declared.</p>

<p>As to this, that new money is made in Flanders and in Scotland, let
proclamation be made that all manner of moneys, as well of Flanders,
Scotland and all other countries beyond the sea whatsoever, be forbidden
from having any currency in England, and that none take them in payment
except to bring them for bullion to the coinage of our lord the King.</p>

<p>Further, it will be altogether for the better and a very great profit to
all the commons, that of the gold money now current, which is so clipped
and otherwise impaired, that of this money, when it shall come to the
Tower and to the coinage, henceforth our lord the King take for his
seigneurage, and the Master for the work for him and his other officers,
nothing more than 10<i>d.</i> in the pound.</p>

<p>Further there will be an increase of the money and profit to the whole
realm if of all other bullion the King take only 12<i>d.</i> for his
seigneurage and the Master of the Mint 12<i>d.</i> for his work.</p>

<p><i>Lincoln, Goldsmith.</i>&mdash;To the noble lords of the Council of our lord the
King, touching the charge which you have given me, please you to take
note of this answer.</p>

<p>Touching the first article, that gold and silver is taken out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> of the
realm, the first remedy against this is that no clerk or purveyor be
suffered to take any silver or gold or to make any exchange to be taken
to the Court of Rome, and no merchant be suffered to pay any money but
only merchandise for merchandise; and also that the money of the Noble,
at the same weight that it now is, be put at a greater value.</p>

<p>And touching the second article, the remedy is that all the money be of
one weight, so that the money that is not of the weight ordained be
bought according to the value.</p>

<p>And touching the third article, the remedy is that halfpence and
farthings be made in great plenty.</p>

<p>And touching the fourth article, the remedy is that there be one weight
and one measure throughout the realm and that no subtle weight be
suffered.</p>

<p>And touching the fifth article, the remedy is contained above in the
first article.</p>

<p><i>Richard Aylesbury.</i>&mdash;As to this, that no gold or silver comes into
England, but that which is in England is carried beyond the sea, we
maintain that if the merchandise which goes out of England be well and
rightly governed, the money that is in England will remain and great
plenty of money will come from beyond the sea, that is to say, let not
more strange merchandise come within the realm than to the value of the
denizen merchandise which passes out of the realm.</p>

<p>Further he says that it were good if the Pope's Collector were English
and the Pope's money were sent to him in merchandise and not in money,
and that the passages of pilgrims and clerks be utterly forbidden, upon
pain, etc.</p>

<p>And as to this, that the gold is too feeble because of clipping, there
seems to us no other remedy than that the gold be generally weighed by
those who shall take it, and hereon let proclamation be made.</p>

<p>As to this, that the gold agrees not with the silver, it cannot be
amended unless the money be changed, and to this we dare not assent for
the common damage that might befall.</p>

<p>As to this, that new money is made in Flanders and in Scotland, let
proclamation be made that all manner of money of Scotland be forbidden.
Let other moneys also that come from beyond the sea have no currency in
England, and let none take them in payment except at the value to bring
for bullion and to the coinage of our lord the King. And let none take
gold or silver out of the realm beyond the sea, as it is ordained by
Statute, and hereof let good ordinance be made as well by search as
otherwise.</p>

<p>And further he says, if it please by way of information, that [it would
be well] if the pound of gold that is now made in the Tower to the sum
of 45 nobles (which pound, because the money thereof is so clipped and
otherwise impaired, is worth at present, taking one with another, 41&frac12;

<p>The agrarian changes which attracted attention from the latter part of
the fifteenth century to the accession of Elizabeth, and again, to a
less degree, at intervals between 1558 and 1660, are a watershed in
economic history, separating medi&aelig;val from modern England as decisively
as did, in other departments of national life, the Reformation and the
Tudor monarchy. For the controversial questions surrounding their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
causes and consequences we must refer the student to the list of books
given below. All that can be attempted here is to notice the special
points upon which the following documents throw light.</p>

<p>In arranging the documents in this section it seemed best not to group
them in strict chronological order, but to place together those relating
to similar aspects of the subject. Documents 1 to 6 illustrate the
status and tenure of different classes of landholders. By the beginning
of the sixteenth century personal villeinage has almost disappeared;
only one document therefore (No. 1) is given to it. Nor has it seemed
necessary to print documents referring specially to the freeholders who,
compared with other classes of tenants, were little affected by the
agrarian changes. On the other hand, the position of the customary
tenants, and of the lessees who farmed manorial demesnes, raises
important questions. Documents 2 to 4 illustrate manorial customs and
the way in which cases between lords and copyholders turned upon them
(Nos 3 and 4). Without entering into controversial questions with regard
to copyhold tenure one may say (<i>a</i>) that it is customary or villein
tenure to which the courts from the beginning of the fifteenth century,
first the court of Chancery&mdash;before which both these cases come&mdash;and
then the Common Law courts, have given protection, (<i>b</i>) that what the
Courts do is to enforce manorial customs, which vary from place to
place. It is, therefore, essential for a tenant who wants, <i>e.g.</i>, to be
protected against eviction (No. 3), or against loss of profitable rights
(No. 4) to show that the lord is committing a breach of the custom.
Hence the dispute (No. 3) as to whether the land at issue is customary
land or part of the lord's demesnes. If it is the former the tenants are
likely to be protected by the Courts: if it is the latter, they are not.
The position of the capitalist farmer, who played so large a part in the
rural economy of the sixteenth century, is illustrated by documents 5
and 6. No. 5 is specially interesting as showing how the earlier
practice of dividing up the demesne lands among numerous small tenants
was replaced by that of leasing them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> in a block to one large farmer.
Documents 7 to 12 illustrate certain points which have already been
mentioned, <i>e.g.</i>, the importance of manorial customs (Nos. 8, 10 and
12). But their peculiar interest consists in the light which they throw
on the grievances of the peasants. They suffer from enclosing (Nos. 7,
8, 10, 11), from excessive fines (Nos. 8, 9, 10, 12), and from rack
renting (Nos. 8, 9, 12). They are gravely prejudiced by the land
speculation following the dissolution of the monasteries (No. 9). They
are too poor and too easily intimidated to get redress even when they
have a good case (Nos. 10, 11, 12). The justices who ought to administer
the acts against depopulation depopulate themselves (No. 8). The
peasants' main resource is the Crown and its Prerogative Courts (Nos. 8,
9, 10, 12). Surely the government will protect men who make good
soldiers and pay taxes (No. 12)! Occasionally, however, they have some
hope of Parliament, <i>e.g.</i>, in 1536, when the royal officials are in bad
odour in the North (No. 7), and under Charles I (No. 11). The exact date
of this last document is uncertain. May it not be 1640-1, when the Long
Parliament was going to restore all good customs?</p>

<p>Documents 13 to 21 illustrate the policy of the government towards the
agrarian problem. The government tried to stop depopulation partly for
financial and military reasons, partly through a genuine dislike of
economic oppression. Its main instruments were four, namely:&mdash;(<i>a</i>)
Statutes (Nos. 13, 15, 17, 18, and 19). Between 1489 and 1597 11 Acts
were passed which had as their object the prevention of depopulation,
viz., 4 Hen. VII, c. 19, 6 Hen. VIII, c. 5, 7 Hen. VIII, c. 1, 25 Hen.
VIII, c. 13, 27 Hen. VIII, c. 22, 5 and 6 Ed. VI, c. 5, 2 and 3 Phil.
and Mary, c. 2, 5 Eliz. c. 2, 31 Eliz. c. 7, 39 Eliz. c. 1, 39 Eliz. c.
2,. All these were repealed by 21 James I, c. 25, except the last, which
was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act of 1863. (For a summary of
these Acts see Slater, <i>The English Peasantry and of the Enclosure
Common Fields, App. D.</i>) (<i>b</i>) Royal Commissions. The first (No. 14) was
appointed in 1517: 6 others followed, in 1548, 1566, 1607, 1632, 1635,
and 1636 (No. 21). (<i>c</i>) Intervention by the Privy Council<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> (Nos. 16 and
20). (<i>d</i>) The Prerogative Courts; viz., the Court of Requests (Nos. 9
and 10), the Court of Star Chamber (No. 21), the Council of the North
(No. 10), and the Council of Wales (Acts of the Privy Council, New
Series, Vol. XXX, pp. 36-7). How far their intervention was successful
is an open question, for a discussion of which reference must be made to
the books mentioned below.</p>

<p class='center'>[<i>Presentment of customs of the manor.</i>]</p>

<p>For the Queen.</p>

<p>3. That the jury ought to present at the court after every tenant's
death or alienation, and who is his heir, and which tenant hath aliened,
and to whom, and what, and who ought to be admitted tenant to the same,
which presentment and admittance ought to be made in open court and be
entered by the steward ... in this form.</p>

<p><i>Ad hanc curiam juratores presentant quod C.D. tenens customarius hujus
manerii, seisitus in dominico suo ut de feodo secundum consuetudinem
manerii unius messuagii etc, post ultimam curiam alienavit tenementa
predicta cuidam H.F. habenda et tenenda eidem H.F. et heredibus suis
secundum consuetudinem manerii, per quod predictus H.F. per
consuetudinem manerii debet solvere dominae Reginae pro ingressu suo
inde habendo 20s.</i></p>

<p>4. No person shall hereafter sell his customary tenement or any part of
it, before he first be admitted tenant or come to court, and require to
be admitted ... offering his fine for the same.</p>

<p>The purchaser of any tenement shall publish the sale at the next court
after the purchase, and cause it to be entered on the rolls, that her
Majesty may be duly answered of the fines, forfeitures and duties as
well of the seller as the purchaser [penalty 20<i>s.</i>]. Any purchaser not
so coming to the second court after the purchase shall forfeit 40<i>s.</i>,
and the lands purchased shall be seized by the steward.</p>

<p>5. As heretofore dividing and portioning of tenements hath caused great
decay chiefly of the service due to her Highness for horses, and of her
woods, and has been the cause of making a great number of poor people in
the lordship, it is now ordered that no one shall divide his tenement or
tenements among his children, but that the least part shall be of the
ancient yearly rent to her Highness of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, and that before
every such division there shall be several houses and ousettes for every
part of such tenement.</p>

<p>Provided always that it be lawful for any one, who has bought any
tenement or farmhold under the yearly rent of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> having houses
and ousette upon it, which has been used as a dwelling house, [to leave
it] to which of his children he thinks best.</p>

<p>And no person holding any part of any tenement shall bargain or put it
away to any person except that person who is tenant of the residue of
the tenement, if he will buy it at a reasonable price. If not, the
tenant may sell it to any other customary tenant of the manor.</p>

<p>10. Every customary tenant and occupier shall uphold his houses
according to our custom, forfeiting 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> <i>toties quoties</i>.</p>

<p>11. No person shall fell timber without delivery of the bailiff, who
shall deliver necessary timber to every tenant or occupier according to
our custom.</p>

<p>12. No tenant or occupier shall sell underwood, etc., nor cut down any
other man's wood in the lordship. Penalty 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, half to her
Highness, half to the party grieved. Every tenant so grieved may have
his action for damages in the court of the lordship.</p>

<p>13. No tenant is to stop any common way nor turn aside a beck. Penalty
6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>

<p>For the tenants.</p>

<p>1. Any tenant, lawfully seised of a messuage or tenement in fee to him
and his heirs according to the custom of the manor, might and may
lawfully give or sell the same by writing, and that the steward or his
deputy ought to be made privy to it at or before next court under
penalty of 20<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The tenant may without the privity of the steward give his tenement in
writing by his last will to which of his sons he thinks best, or any
other person. If any customary tenant die seised of an estate of
inheritance without a will or devise, then his eldest son or next cousin
ought to have the tenement, as his next heir, according to the custom of
the manor.</p>

<p>2. If any customary tenant die seised of a customary tenement, having no
sons but a daughter or daughters, then the eldest daughter being
unpreferred in marriage shall have the tenement as his next heir, ...
and she shall pay to her younger sister, if she have but one sister, 20
years' ancient rent, as is answered to her Majesty; and if she have more
than one sister, she shall pay 40 years' ancient rent to be equally
divided among them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The widow of any customary tenant having any estate of inheritance
ought to have her widowright, viz., one-third of the same, as long as
she is unmarried and chaste, according to our custom.</p>

<p>4. For the avoiding of great trouble in the agreements with younger
brothers, it is now ordered that the oldest son shall pay to his
brothers in the form following:&mdash;</p>

<p>If there is but 1 brother, 12 years' ancient rent.</p>

<p>If there are 2 brothers, 16 years' ancient rent, to be equally divided.</p>

<p>If there be 3 or more, 20 years' ancient rent, to be equally divided.</p>

<p>Provided that any father being a tenant may make a will dividing the
money among his sons as he think best, provided he exceed not these sums
and rates.</p>

<p>5. Whereas great inconvenience has grown by certain persons that at the
marriages of sons or daughters have promised their tenements to the same
son or daughter and their heirs according to the custom of the manor,
and afterwards put the tenement away to another person, it is ordered,
that whatever tenements a tenant shall promise to his son or daughter
being his sole heir apparent at the time of his or her marriage, the
same ought to come to them according to the same covenant, which ought
to be showed at the next court.</p>

<p>6. If a tenant has a child, not his heir, an idiot or impotent, and die
without disposition of his tenement, the same child shall be sustained
out of the said tenement by direction of the steward or his deputy and 4
men sworn in court.</p>

<p>7. Finally be it agreed that no bye-law shall be any way prejudicial to
her Majesty.</p>

<p>To quiet Plaintiff in possession of certain land holden of the manor
of Cromwell in Wymondham by copy of court roll, according to the
custom of the said manor.</p>

<p>To the right honorable Sir Richard Rich, knight, lord Rich and lord
Chancellor of England.</p>

<p>In most humble wise sheweth and complaineth unto your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> lordship your
daily orators, Richard Cullyer of Wymondham in the county of Norfolk,
yeoman, and John Cullyer his son, that where one Edmund Mychell was
seised in his demesne as of fee of and in twenty acres of land lying in
Wymondham aforesaid, holden of the manor of Cromwell, in Wymondham
aforesaid, by copy of court roll at will of the lord of the said manor,
according to the custom of the said manor, which twenty acres of land
have used to be demised and demittable by copy of court roll for term of
life, lives, or in fee, to be holden at will of the lord of the said
manor by copy of court roll, according to the custom of the said manor
time out of remembrance of man; and the said Edmund Mychell, so being
seised of the said twenty acres, for a sum of money to him paid by the
said Richard Cullyer, the father, did surrender the said twenty acres
according to the custom of the said manor, by the name of twenty acres
of bond land enclosed in a close called Reading, in Brawyck, in
Wymondham aforesaid, into the hands of the lords of the said manor by
the hands of William Smythe, in the presence of Geoffry Symondes and
John Love, being then copyholders of the said manor, to the use of your
said orators, their heirs and assigns: By force whereof your said
orators, after that they had paid the accustomable fine due for the same
to the lords of the said manor, were admitted tenants thereof, to hold
the same, to them and their heirs, at will of the lord of the said manor
by copy of court roll, according to the custom of the said manor, and
from the time of the said surrender which was made, as is aforesaid,
thirty years past; and continued seised of the said twenty acres in
their demesne as of fee, as tenants at will, by copy of court roll,
according to the custom of the said manor; and have received and taken
the profits thereof, doing and paying the rents, customs and services of
the same to the lords of the same manor, according to the custom of the
said manor; and at their great travail, costs, and charges have stubbed,
drained, and dyked the premises, whereby they have improved the said
twenty acres and made it much better than it was at the time that the
same was surrendered to them as is aforesaid: And now so it is, right
honorable lord, that the moiety of the said manor is descended to one
Thomas Knyvett esquire, as son and heir to Sir Edmund Knyvett, knight,
deceased, who, of a covetous mind, contrary to the mind and without the
assent of one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> John Flowrdew, gentleman, who is tenant in common with
him of the said manor land, of late claimed ten acres of the said twenty
acres to be the demesnes of the said manor, and have prohibited your
said orators to occupy the same ten acres; and because your said orators
doth not leave the occupation thereof, the said Thomas Knyvett hath
divers times disturbed the possession of your orators in the premises by
taking of divers distresses, and now of late have taken and distrained
in the said close four steers and one bull of the value of five pounds,
of the goods and chattels of the said John Cullyer, one of your said
orators; which the said Thomas did impound and withhold from your said
orators until deliverance was made to him thereof by virtue of the
King's majesty's writ of <i>replevin</i>; which writ of <i>replevin</i> is removed
into the King's court of his common pleas at Westminster, by a writ of
<i>recordere facias [sic]</i>, where the said suit doth yet depend
undetermined; and forasmuch as your said beseechers have no better
estate in the premises but as copyholders according to the custom of the
said manor, and that the court rolls of the said manor, whereby your
beseechers should prove the said twenty acres to be an ancient copyhold
land, do remain in the possession of the said Thomas Knyvett, and for
that also that your orators be poor men and the said Thomas Knyvett a
gentleman of great worship, your said poor orators be most like to lose
their said land, and to be clearly without remedy in the premises,
unless your lordship's favour be to them shewed in that behalf: In
consideration whereof, it may please your lordship to grant the King's
most gracious writ of <i>subp&oelig;na</i>, to be directed to the said Thomas
Knyvett, commanding him by virtue thereof personally to appear before
your lordship in the King's most honorable court of Chancery at a
certain day, and under a certain pain, by your lordship to be appointed,
then and there to answer the premises, and further to abide to such
order therein as shall seem to your lordship agreeing to equity and good
conscience; and your poor orators shall daily pray for the prosperous
estate of your good lordships in honour long to continue.</p>

<p class='center'><i>Answer.</i></p>

<p>The answer of Thomas Knivet, esquire, to the bill of complaint of
Richard Cullyer and John Cullyer, plaintiffs.</p>

<p>The said defendant saith, that the said bill of complaint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> is uncertain
and untrue in itself, and insufficient in the law to be answered unto,
and that the matters therein contained be untruly surmised by the said
complainants to the only intent to put the said defendant to vexation,
trouble and cost, and is grounded of malice, they the said complainants
having no colour of right, title, nor interest unto the said land
mentioned in the said bill of complaint; and he, the said defendant, to
the matters contained in the same bill, doth think that he by the order
of the right honorable court shall not be compelled any further to
answer, but be dismissed out of the same for the insufficiency thereof,
with his reasonable costs and charges by him sustained in that behalf;
Yet nevertheless, if he, the said defendant, shall be compelled any
further to answer to the same bill, then he, the same defendant, for
further answer saith that the said land, lying in Brawyck Reading
mentioned in the said bill of complaint, is and have been time out of
mind parcel of the demesnes of the said moiety of the said manor of
Cromwell, in Wymondham; and he, the said defendant, for further answer
saith, that one Sir Edmund Knyvett, father to the said defendant, and
all his ancestors of long time before him, have been seised of one
estate of inheritance of the moiety of the said manor, and one-half of
the said manor of Cromwell, and that the said Sir Edmund, and all his
ancestors, of long time have been seised of the premises with the
appurtenances as parcel of the said manor, in their demesne as of fee,
and had the possession thereof, and so seised, died thereof by
protestation seised; after whose death the premises descended and came
and of right ought to descend and come unto the said defendant, as to
the son and next heir of the said Sir Edmund, by force whereof he, the
same defendant, entered into the premises, and was and is thereof seised
in his demesne as of fee, and the same complainants, claiming the
premises by force of a surrender made unto them, the said complainants,
by one Edmund Mychell in the time of one [<i>blank</i>] being guardian of the
said Sir Edmund, and having the custody of the body and lands of the
said Sir Edmund during his minority, where nothing in right nor law can
pass by the same surrender, but the same is utterly void to bind the
said defendant, did enter; upon whom the said defendant did re-enter, as
it was lawful for him to do, without that the said Edmund Mychell was
lawfully seised in his demesne as of fee, of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> lands mentioned in the
said bill by copy of court roll at will of the lord according to the
custom of the said manor, as in the said bill is untruly alleged, or
that the said Edmund Mychell had any lawful interest in the same, or
could lawfully make any good or effectual surrender of the same to the
said complainants, or that the premises have been used to be demitted or
be demittable by copy of court roll for term of life or lives, or in
fee, to be holden at the will of the lord by copy of court roll,
according to the custom of the said manor time out of mind, as in the
said bill of complaint is also untruly alleged, for he, the said
defendant, saith that by divers ancient precedents and court rolls ready
to be shewed to your honourable court it may appear that the same hath
been letten for term of years by the lords of the said manor after the
time being unto them, by whom the said complainants claim; or that the
same Edmund Mychell for a sum of money to him paid by Richard Cullyer,
their father, did surrender the premises, as in the same bill is also
untruly alleged, for he, the said defendant, saith, that he the same
Edmund had no right nor lawful interest to surrender the same; and if
any such surrender were, yet the said defendant saith that the same is
verily void in law; or that the said complainants paid any fine for the
premises, or were admitted tenants to hold at the will of the lord, as
in the same bill is also untruly alleged. And if any such were, yet the
same being paid unto his father's said guardian, and their admission by
the said guardian, the premises being of the demesnes of the said manor,
ought not in no wise to bind him; and without that any other thing
mentioned in the said bill of complaint here in this answer not
sufficiently confessed, and avoided, traversed, or denied, is true or
material to be answered unto, all which matters the said defendant is
ready to aver and prove, as this right honorable court shall award.
Whereupon the said defendant prayeth to be dismissed out of this right
honorable court with his reasonable costs and charges by him sustained
in that behalf.</p>

<p>To the right honorable Sir Nicholas Bacon, knight, Lord Keeper of the
Great Seal of England.</p>

<p>In most humble wise sheweth and complaineth to your good Lordship your
daily orators John Wyat, John Blake, John Whittington, Thomas Knight,
Thomas Ellis, Thomas Moris, Richard Cooke, Symon Lucas, and Richard
Blake, with divers other poor men to the number of forty, customary
tenants of the manor of Slindon in the County of Sussex.[period? or
comma?] That where they and their ancestors and those whose estate they
have in the said customary tenements, parcel of the said manor (time out
of memory of man) have been seised to them and to their heirs for ever
according to the custom of the said manor, all and every which customs
of late one Anthony Kempe esquire, lord of the said manor, hath
diversely, contrary to conscience and equity, devised and imagined by
divers indirect means to break, annihilate, and infringe, and your said
orators hath diversely vexed and troubled by the order of the common
laws and menaceth to expel your said orators out of their several
tenements unless they will pay other customs and services than they of
right ought to do by the customs of the said manor. For where by the
custom of the said manor your Lordship's said orators and those whose
estate they or any of them have in the premises, have been lawfully and
quietly seised of the said tenements customary in their demesne as of
fee according to the custom of the said manor for the several services
thereupon due and accustomed, clearly discharged of all day works,
licences of marriage or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> fines for the same, and having always free
liberty to let all and singular the premises aforesaid without any
licence beforehand to be obtained of the lords of the said manor for the
time being, neither have further at any time done any manner of services
whatsoever out of the said manor: And also where after the death of
every of the said customary tenants, having a whole yardland, there hath
been due for heriot only the best beast, and if such have no beast, then
10<i>s.</i> in money only; and after the death of every tenant holding half a
yardland 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for relief only, and after the death of every
cottager 6<i>d.</i> only, and at every alienation of a yardland 10<i>s.</i> in
money, and at every alienation of a half yardland 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> in money,
and at the alienation of every cottage 6<i>d.</i>, and at the death and
alienation of every tenant one whole year's rent only for and in the
name of a fine, over and besides the only heriot or relief aforesaid,
and suit of court and other services in this bill specified: And where
by the further custom of the said manor the lords of the said manor for
the time being by the custom of the said manor should make no seizure or
forfeiture for waste done in their cottages customary, unless the same
be severally presented at the several Courts to be holden one half year
after another, and the same yet then not reformed within one month
after; And where the cutting down of any the woods standing and growing
upon their several tenements customary for house-bote, fire-bote,
plough-bote, cart-bote, gate-bote and hedge-bote, and such like hath not
heretofore been taken for waste but always as lawful to do by the custom
of the said manor; And where also by the further custom of the said
manor, where any forfeiture is committed, perpetrated or done for any
offence whatsoever whereby there is given cause of seizure and
forfeiture to the lord of the manor for the time being, yet by the
custom of the same manor, the said forfeiture notwithstanding, they to
whom the same so forfeited should descend, remain, come, or grow after
the death of such tenant so offending, should and may lawfully claim all
and singular such tenements so forfeited or seized after the death of
such offender, as though no such forfeiture had been made; And where by
the custom of the said manor all and every the tenants of the said manor
should and ought to have from time to time in the woods of the lord of
the said manor sufficient timber for reparations of their said tenements
customary at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> assignment of the lord or his officers, and if the
lord the same refuse to do upon reasonable request being thereof made to
the said lord or his steward of his court for the time being, if then
their said tenements decay, or fall down in default of reparations,
there shall nor ought any forfeiture or seizure to be made for any such
waste; And where the widows of the tenants customary of the said manor
should and ought by the custom of the said manor have their widow's
estate for one penny only; And where by their further custom the eldest
son, brother or next cousin, male or female, should inherit and have the
said customaries and after the decease of their ancestors only; And
where by the custom of the said manor it is lawful for the said tenants
as aforesaid to assign and demise the several tenements for years to any
person or persons at their will and pleasure, yet nevertheless by the
custom of the said manor it hath been lawful for the lord of the said
manor misliking the said undertenant upon one year's warning to expel
and put out such tenant, after which it shall be lawful for the said
tenants that so did demise or let their tenements to re-enter and the
same to enjoy as before, and after to let the same as before to any
person or persons in manner and form aforesaid, until such person shall
be by the lord misliked and expulsed as aforesaid; And where by the
further custom of the said manor the said tenants and every of them and
their heirs and assigns should and ought to have the masting of their
own hogs in the time of mast in the north woods of the said manor of
Slindon, and likewise the pasturing of their cattle and sheep in the
said woods and in all other the lord's commons of the said manor, paying
for the ovissing<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> and masting of every hog 2<i>d.</i> only; And whereas
by the further custom of the said manor the tenants aforesaid have and
may at their will and pleasure surrender into the hands of two tenants
of the said manor out of the court, or into the hands of the lord or his
steward in the court, to the use of any person or person of such estate
as they shall declare and limit upon the said surrender, yet
nevertheless by the custom of the said manor it is not lawful for any
tenant of the said manor to convey, surrender or alienate any one part,
parcel or piece of their tenement customary, unless he give and
surrender the whole to the use of one only person in possession; And
where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> youngest tenant of any customary tenement for the time being
ought to be crier in the lord's court by the custom of the said manor:
All which customs are not only to be proved to be the old and ancient
customs of the said manor, but also now of late the said Anthony Kempe
hath by his deed indented declared the same to be true in manner and
form as it is before alleged; And where by the said Indenture the said
Anthony Kempe hath further, for and in consideration of a further and a
new rent of eight pounds to him granted, and for and in consideration of
twenty pounds to him paid, and for and in consideration to make a
perpetual and final end of all controversies heretofore moved and after
to be moved, doth further covenant and grant in the said indenture that
it shall be lawful for the customary tenants and copyholders of the said
manor to enclose, and sever, and severally to hold to them and to their
heirs and assigns forever six score acres of land, parcel of the wastes
of the lords of the said manor, wherein they now have common, in such
place convenient to be limited before the feast of Easter next coming,
by consent of two persons to be named by the said Anthony Kempe and two
other persons by the said tenants; All the which premises
notwithstanding, the said Anthony Kempe doth against all conscience
utterly deny unto your Lordship's said orators their said customs and
the aforesaid further agreement according to the said indenture, and
doth daily vex your said orators quietly to have and enjoy their said
customary tenants [<i>sic</i>] with their appurtenances according to the
customs aforesaid. May it therefore please your good lordship the
premises favourably tendering to grant the Queen's Majesty's writ of
<i>subp&oelig;na</i> to be directed to the said Anthony Kempe commanding him
thereby personally to appear in this honourable Court at a day certain
in the said writ of <i>subp&oelig;na</i> mentioned, then and there upon his
corporal oath to answer to the premises and to abide such order therein
as to your Lordship shall upon the truth of the matter appearing seem
according to equity; and your said poor orators shall daily pray to God
for the continual preservation of your honor.</p>

avoiding trouble and suit between them and their poor parishioners which
they daily do precede and attempt, shall from henceforth take for the
full contentation [<i>i.e.</i> satisfaction] of all the tenths which now they
do receive but viiid of the noble in the full discharge of all other
tithes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>We pray that no man under the degree of [<i>blank</i>] shall keep any conies
upon any of their own freehold or copyhold unless he pale them in so
that it shall not be to the commons' nuisance.</p>

<p>We pray that no person, of what estate, degree or condition he be, shall
from henceforth sell the wardship of any child, but that the same child
if he live to his full age shall be at his own chosen concerning his
marriage, the King's wards only except.</p>

<p>We pray that no manner of person having a manor of his own shall be no
other lord's bailiff but only his own.</p>

<p>We pray that no lord knight nor gentleman shall have or take in farm any
spiritual promotion.</p>

<p>We pray that your Grace to give license and authority by your gracious
commission under your great seal to such commissioners as your poor
commons hath chosen, or as many of them as your Majesty and your council
shall appoint and think meet, for to redress and reform all such good
laws, statutes, proclamations, and all other your proceedings, which
hath been hidden by your justices of your peace, sheriffs, escheators,
and other your officers from your poor commons, since the first year of
the reign of your noble grandfather King Henry VII.</p>

<p>We pray that those your officers that hath offended your Grace and your
commons, and so proved by the complaint of your poor commons, do give
unto these poor men so assembled iiijd. every day so long as they have
remained there.</p>

<p>We pray that no lord, knight, esquire nor gentleman do graze nor feed
any bullocks or sheep if he may spend forty pounds a year by his lands,
but only for the provision of his house.</p>

these words. They should probably be read as referring to enclosures
made not by lords or by large farmers, but by the peasants themselves.
The rebels point out that a considerable number of people have spent
capital on hedging and ditching their lands for the better cultivation
of saffron, and therefore ask that, while other enclosures should be
pulled down, a special exception may be made in favour of this
particular kind of enclosure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p></div>

Majesty's Court of Requests at the suit as well of Robert Stor as
William Poskett and William Browne, tenants to Sir John Yorke, knight,
in the Lordship of Whitby in the County of York, is now ordered by the
said Council<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> by the agreement of the said Sir John, who hath promised
that the said parties afore named, and every of them, shall have and
quietly enjoy their tenements and holds during the years and terms in
their leases and copies yet enduring, paying their rents and farms
accustomed without any interruption to the contrary or any other by him
or in his name or procurement.</p>

North</span> [<i>R.O. Requests Proceedings. Bundle III, No. 24</i>], 1576.</p>

<p class='center'><i>To the Queen's most excellent Majesty.</i></p>

<p>In most humble wise sheweth unto your Majesty your poor subject Thomas
Langhorne, and other the inhabitants and residents of the lordship of
Thornthwaite in your county of Westmoreland, that whereas your suppliant
and other of the inhabitants and residents of the lordship aforesaid,
and their ancestors time out of memory of man, have quietly had and
enjoyed from heir to heir according to their ancient custom in
consideration of their service to be in readiness with horse,<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
harness and other furniture to serve your Majesty at their own costs and
charges in defence of your realm against the Scots, which custom hath
been sufficiently approved and allowed before your Majesty's President
and Council at York, as by a decree ready to be shewed more at large it
may appear. But so it is, and if it please your Majesty, that Sir Henry
Curwyn, knight, lord of the lordship aforesaid, hath since the beginning
of your Majesty's reign expelled out of one piece of Shapps parish
within the said lordship, where there was but thirteen tenants, twelve
of them he hath expelled and taken their land from them and enclosed it
into his demesnes, whereby your Majesty's service for the same is
utterly taken away: and also the said Sir Henry Curwyn, lord of the
lordship aforesaid, hath of late surrendered over the same lordship to
Nicholas Curwyn, gentleman, his son and heir, which Sir Henry and
Nicholas do excessively fine the poor tenants and specially your orator,
who was forced to pay them for the fine of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> tenement, being but
13<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> by year, 31<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, and was admitted tenant to
the said Nicholas Curwyn, who notwithstanding hath contrary to all right
and conscience granted a lease of your subject's tenement to one Henry
Curwyn, servant to the same Nicholas, in the nature of an <i>ejection

Rights of Common</span> [<i>Topographer and Genealogist, Vol. III</i>], <i>temp.</i>
Charles I.</p>

<p>To the Right Honourable House of Parliament now assembled, the humble
petition of the Mayor and Free Tenants of the Borough of Wootton Basset
in the County of Wilts.</p>

<p>Humbly showeth to this Honourable House, That whereas the Mayor and Free
Tenants of the said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> Borough, by relation of our ancient predecessors,
had and did hold unto them free common of pasture for the feeding of all
sorts of other beasts, as cows, etc., without stint, be they never so
many, in and through Eastern Great Park, which said park contained by
estimation 2000 acres of ground or upwards; and in the second and third
year of the reign of King Philip and Queen Mary the manor of Wootton
Basset aforesaid came by patent into the hands and possession of one Sir
Francis Englefield, knight, who, in short time after he was thereof
possessed, did enclose the said park; and in consideration of the common
of pasture that the free tenants of the borough had in the said park did
grant, condescend and lease out unto the said free tenants of the said
borough to use as common amongst them that parcel of the said Great Park
which formerly was and now is called by the name of Wootton Lawnd, which
was but a small portion to that privilege which they had before it,
[and] doth not contain by estimation above 100 acres; but the free
tenants being therewith contented, the mayor and free tenants did
equally stint the said ground or common, as followeth:&mdash;that is to say
to the mayor of the town for the time being two cows feeding, and to the
constable one cow feeding, and to every inhabitant of the said borough,
each and every of them, one cow feeding and no more, as well the poor as
the rich, and every one to make and maintain a certain parcel or bound
set forth to every person; and ever after that inclosure for the space
of fifty and six years or thereabouts any messuage, burgage or tenement
that was bought or sold within the said borough did always buy and sell
the said cows-leaze together with the said messuage or burgage as part
member of the same, as doth and may appear by divers deeds which are yet
to be seen; and about which time, as we are informed and do verily
believe, that Sir Francis Englefield, heir of the aforesaid Sir Francis
Englefield, did by some means gain the charter of our town into his
hands, and as lately we have heard his successor now keepeth it; and we
do believe that at the same time he did likewise gain the deed of the
said common, and he thereby knowing that the town had nothing to show
for their rights of common but by prescription, did begin suits in law
with the said free tenants for their common, and did vex them with so
many suits in law for the space of seven or eight years at the least,
and never suffer anyone to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> come to trial in all that space, but did
divers times attempt to gain his possession thereof by putting in of
divers sorts of cattle, in so much that at length, when his servants did
put in cows by force into the said common, many times and present upon
the putting of them in, the Lord in his mercy did send thunder and
lightning from heaven, which did make the cattle of the said Francis
Englefield to run so violent out of the said ground that at one time one
of the beasts was killed therewith; and it was so often that people that
were not there in presence to see it, when it thundered, would say Sir
Francis Englefield's men were putting in their cattle into the Lawnd,
and so it was, and as soon as those cattle were gone forth it would
presently be very calm and fair, and the cattle of the town would never
stir but follow their feeding as at other times, and never offer to move
out of the way but did follow their feeding. And this did continue so
long, he being too powerful for them, that the said free tenants were
not able to wage law any longer; for one John Rous, one of the free
tenants, was thereby enforced to sell all his land (to the value of
&pound;500) with following the suits in law, and many others were thereby
impoverished and were thereby forced to yield up their right and take a
lease of their said common of the said Sir Francis Englefield for term
of his life. And the said mayor and free tenants hath now lost their
right of common in the said Lawnd near about twenty years, which this
Sir Francis Englefield, his heirs and his trustees, now detaineth from
them. Likewise the said Sir Francis Englefield hath taken away their
shops or shambles standing in the middle of the street in the
market-place from the town, and hath given them to a stranger that
liveth not in the town.... And he hath altered and doth seek ways and
means to take the election of the mayor of our town to himself; for
whereas the mayor is chosen at the law-day and the jury did ever make
choice of two men of the town and the lord of the manor was to appoint
one of them to serve, which the lord of the manor refused, and caused
one to stay in two years together divers times, which is a breach of our
custom.</p>

<p>And as for our common we do verily believe that no corporation in
England so much is wronged as we are. For we are put out of all the
common that ever we had and have not so much as one foot of common left
unto us, nor never shall have any. We are thereby grown so in poverty,
unless it please<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> God to move the hearts of this Honourable House to
commiserate our cause, and to enact something for us, that we may enjoy
our right again. And your orators shall be ever bound to pray for your
health and prosperity to the Lord.</p>

<p class='center'>[here follow 23 signatures.]</p>

<p>Divers hands more we might have had, but that many of them doth rent
bargains of the lord of the manor, and they are fearful that they shall
be put forth of their bargains; and then they shall not tell how to
live. Otherwise they would have set to their hands.</p>

Charles I, Vol. 151, No. 38</i>], 1629.</p>

<p>To the King's most Excellent Majesty.</p>

<p>The humble petition of your Majesty's poor and distressed tenants of
your manor of North Wheatley in the county of Nottingham belonging to
your Majesty's Duchy of Lancaster.</p>

<p>Most humbly shewing: That your poor subjects have time out of mind been
copyholders of lands of inheritance to them and their heirs for ever of
the manor aforesaid, and paid for every oxgang of land xvi<i>s.</i> viii<i>d.</i>
rent, and paid heretofore upon every alienation xii<i>d.</i> for every
oxgang, but now of late, about 4<sup><i>o</i></sup> Jacobi by an order of the Duchy
Court they pay xi<i>s.</i> vi<i>d.</i> upon every alienation for every acre, which
amounteth now to 45<i>s.</i> an oxgang.</p>

<p>And whereas some of your tenants of the said manor have heretofore held
and do now hold certain oxgangs of lands belonging to the said manor by
copy from 21 years to 21 years, and have paid for the same upon every
copy 2<i>s.</i>, and for every oxgang 16<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per annum, they now of
late, by an order in the Duchy Court, hold the same by lease under the
Duchy Seal, and pay 6<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for a fine upon every lease and
16<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> rent with an increase of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> more towards your
Majesty's provision.</p>

<p>And whereas in 11<sup><i>o</i></sup> Edw. 4<sup><i>i</i></sup>, your petitioners did by copy of
court roll hold the demesnes of the said manor for term of years at
9<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per annum, they afterwards in 6<sup><i>o</i></sup> Eliz. held the
same demesnes by lease under the seal of the Duchy for 21 years, at the
like rent. And ten years before their lease was expired, they employed
one Mr. Markham in trust to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> their lease renewed, who procured a new
lease of the demesnes in his own name for 21 years at the old rent, and
afterwards, contrary to the trust committed to him, increased and raised
the rent thereof upon the tenants to his own private benefit to 56<i>l.</i>
per annum.</p>

<p>And whereas the woods belonging to the said manor hath within the memory
of man been the only common belonging to the said town, paying yearly
for the herbage and pannage thereof 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, they now also hold the
same under the Duchy Seal at 16<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> per annum.</p>

<p>And whereas the court rolls and records of the said manor have always
heretofore been kept under several locks and keys, whereof your
Majesty's stewards have kept one key and your Majesty's tenants (in
regard it concerned their particular inheritances) have kept another
key; but now they are at the pleasure of the stewards and officers
transported from place to place, and the now purchasers do demand the
custody of them, which may be most prejudicial to your Majesty's poor
tenants.</p>

<p>Now forasmuch as your Majesty hath been pleased to sell the said manor
unto the City of London, who have sold the same unto Mr. John Cartwright
and Mr. Tho. Brudnell, gent.: and for that your petitioners and tenants
there (being in number two hundred poor men, and there being 11 of your
Majesty's tenants there, that bear arms for the defence of your
Majesty's realm, and 12 that pay your Majesty subsidies, fifteens, and
loans) are all now like to be utterly undone, in case the said Mr.
Cartwright and Mr. Brudnell should (as they say they will) take away
from your tenants the said demesnes and woods after the expiration of
their leases, and that your poor tenants should be left to the wills of
the purchasers for their fines, or that the records and court rolls
should not be kept as in former times in some private place, where the
purchasers and tenants may both have the custody and view of them as
occasion shall serve;</p>

<p>May it therefore please your sacred Majesty that such order may be taken
in the premises for the relief of your poor tenants of the manor
aforesaid, that they may not be dispossessed of the demesnes and leases,
and that they may know the certainty of their fines for the copyhold,
demesnes and leases, and may have the court rolls and records safely
kept as formerly they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> have been, and that your Majesty will be further
pleased to refer the consideration, hearing, ordering and determination
of the premises unto such noblemen, or other four gentlemen of esteem in
the country, whom your Majesty shall be pleased to appoint, that are
neighbours unto your tenants, and do best know their estate and
grievances. That they or any two or three of them may take such order,
and so settle the business between the purchasers and your poor tenants,
as they in their wisdom and discretion shall judge to be reasonable and
fitting, or to certify your Majesty how they find the same and in whose
default it is they cannot determine thereof. And your poor tenants as in
all humble duty bound will daily pray for your Majesty.</p>

<p>Whitehall, this 10th of November, 1629.</p>

<p>His Majesty is graciously pleased to refer the consideration of this
request to the commissioners for sale of his lands, that upon the report
unto his Majesty of their opinion and advice his Majesty may give
further order therein.</p>

<p>The King our Sovereign Lord calling to his most blessed remembrance that
where great inconveniences be and daily increase by dislocation, pulling
down, and destruction of houses and towns within this realm, and laying
to pasture lands which customably have been manured and occupied with
tillage and husbandry, whereby idleness doth increase, for where in some
one town 200 persons, men and women and children, and their ancestors
out of time of mind, were daily occupied and lived by sowing corn and
grains, breeding of cattle, and other increase necessary for man's
sustenance, and now the said persons and their progenies be minished and
decreased, whereby the husbandry which is the greatest commodity of this
realm for sustenance of man is greatly decayed, Churches destroyed, the
service of God withdrawn, Christian people there buried not prayed for,
the patrons and curates wronged, cities, market towns brought to great
ruin and decay, necessaries for man's sustenance made scarce and dear,
the people sore minished in the realm, whereby the power and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> defence
thereof is enfeebled and impaired, to the high displeasure of God and
against his laws and to the subversion of the common weal of this realm
and dislocation of the same, if substantial and speedy remedy be not
thereof provided; wherefore the King our Sovereign Lord, by the advice
and assent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, in this
present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,
ordaineth, stablisheth and enacteth, that all such towns, villages,
boroughs and hamlets, tything houses and other habitations in any parish
or parishes within this realm, whereof the more part the first day of
this present parliament was or were used and occupied to tillage and
husbandry, [as] by the owner or owners thereof for their singular
profit, avail, and lucre wilfully since the said first day be or
hereafter shall be suffered or caused to fall down and decay, whereby
the husbandry of the said towns, villages, boroughs, hamlets, tithings
houses and other habitations and parishes within this realm been or
hereafter shall be decayed, and turned from the said use and occupation
of husbandry and tillage into pasture, shall be by the said owner or
owners, their heirs, successors or assigns or other for them, within one
year next after such wilful decay, re-edified and made again meet and
convenient for people to dwell and inhabit in the same, and to have use
and therein to exercise husbandry and tillage as at the said first day
of this present parliament or since was there used, occupied and had,
after the manner and usage of the country where the said land lieth, at
the cost and charges of the same owner or owners, their heirs,
successors or assigns. And if since the said first day of this present
parliament any lands which at the same first day or since were commonly
used in tillage, been enclosed or from henceforth shall be enclosed and
turned only to pasture, whereby any house of husbandry within this realm
is or shall be hereafter decayed, that then all such lands shall be by
the same owner or owners, their heirs, successors or assigns or other
for them, within one year next ensuing the same decay, put in tillage,
and exercised, used and occupied in husbandry and tillage, as they were
the first said day of this present parliament or any time since, after
the manner and usage of the country where such land lieth; and if any
person or persons do contrary to the premises or any of them, that then

of any such lands whereof the house or houses of husbandry be not so
maintained and sustained, and the same half deal of the issues and
profits to have, hold and keep to his or their own use without anything
thereof to be paid or given, to such time as the same house or houses be
sufficiently re-edified, built or repaired again, for the exercising and
occupying of husbandry; and immediately after that, as well the interest
and title given by this Act to our Sovereign Lord the King as to the
lords of the fee to cease and no longer to endure; and that it shall be
lawful to the owner and owners of such lands, house or houses holden

Roll 9 Hen. VIII, p. 2, m. 6d.</i>], 1517.</p>

<p>The King to his beloved and faithful John Veysy, dean of our Chapel,
Andrew Wyndesore, knight, and Roger Wegeston, late of Leicester,
greeting. Whereas of late in times past divers our lieges, not having
before their eyes either God or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> benefit and advantage of our realm
or the defence of the same, have enclosed with hedges and dykes and
other enclosures certain towns, hamlets and other places within this our
realm of England, where many of our subjects dwelt and there yearly and
assiduously occupied and exercised tillage and husbandry, and have
expelled and ejected the same our subjects dwelling therein from their
holdings and farms, and have reduced the country round the houses, towns
and hamlets aforesaid, and the fields and lands within the same, to
pasture and for flocks of sheep and other animals to graze there for the
sake of their private gain and profit, and have imparked certain great
fields and pasture and woods of the same in large and broad parks, and
certain others in augmentation of parks for deer only to graze there,
whereby the same towns, hamlets and places are not only brought to
desolation, but also the houses and buildings of the same are brought to
so great ruin, that no vestige of the same at the present is left, and
our subjects, who have dwelt in the said places and there occupied and
exercised tillage and husbandry, are now brought to idleness, which is
the step-mother of virtues, and daily live in idleness, and the crops
and breeding of cattle that were bred and nourished by the same tillers
and husbandmen dwelling in the same towns, hamlets and places for human
sustenance, are withdrawn and entirely voided from the same places, and
the churches and chapels there hallowed are destroyed and divine
services there taken away, and the memory of souls of Christians buried
there utterly and wholly perished, and many other inestimable damages
grow therefrom and daily hereafter will grow, to the greatest desolation
and undoing of our realm and diminution of our subjects, unless an
opportune remedy for the reformation of the same be swiftly and speedily
applied: We, as we are duly bound, desiring to reform the aforesaid and
wishing to be certified touching the same, what and how many towns and
hamlets and how many houses and buildings have been thrown down from the
feast of St. Michael the Archangel in the fourth year of the reign of
the most illustrious lord Henry, late King of England, the Seventh, our
father, and how many and how great lands which were then in tillage are
now enclosed and converted to pasture, and how many and how great parks
have been imparked for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> the feeding of deer since the same feast, and
what lands have been enclosed in any parks or any park, which then were
or was, for the amplifying and enlarging of such parks, have therefore
appointed you and two of you to enquire by oath of good and lawful men
of the counties of Oxford, Berks, Warwick, Leicester, Bedford,
Buckingham, and Northampton, as well within liberties as without, and by
other ways, manners and means whereby you shall or may the better learn
the truth, what and how many towns, how many houses and buildings have
been thrown down from the aforesaid feast, and how many and how great
lands which were then in tillage are now converted to pasture, and how
many and how great parks have been enclosed for the feeding of deer on
this side the same feast, and what lands have been enclosed in any parks
or any park, which then were or was, for the enlargement of such parks,
and by whom, where, when, how and in what manner, and touching other
articles and circumstances in any wise concerning the premises,
according to the tenour and effect of certain articles specified in a
bill to these presents annexed. And therefore we command you that you
attend diligently to the premises and do and execute the same with
effect. And by the tenour of these presents we command our sheriffs of
the counties aforesaid that at certain days and places, which you shall
cause them to know, they cause to come before you or two of you as many
and such good and lawful men of their bailiwick by whom the truth of the
matter may the better be known and enquired of; and that you certify us
in our Chancery of what you shall do in the premises in three weeks from
the day of St. Michael next coming, together with this commission. In
witness whereof, etc. Witness the King at Westminster, the 28th day of
May.</p>

the administrative methods of the Tudor statesmen (see Leadam, <i>Domesday

Statutes of the Realm, Vol. III, p. 451</i>], 1533-4.</p>

<p>Forasmuch as divers and sundry [persons] of the king's subjects of this
realm, to whom God of his goodness hath disposed great plenty and
abundance of moveable substance, now of late within few years have daily
studied, practised and invented ways and means how they might accumulate
and gather together into few hands as well great multitude of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> farms as
great plenty of cattle and in especial sheep, putting such lands as they
can get to pasture and not to tillage, whereby they have not only pulled
down churches and towns and enhanced the old rates of their rents of the
possessions of this realm, or else brought it to such excessive fines
that no poor man is able to meddle with it, but also have raised and
enhanced the prices of all manner of corn, cattle, wool, pigs, geese,
hens, chickens, eggs and such other almost double above the prices which
hath been accustomed, by reason whereof a marvellous multitude and
number of people of this realm be not able to provide meat, drink and
clothes necessary for themselves, their wives and children, but be so
discouraged with misery and poverty that they fall daily to theft,
robbery and other inconvenience, or pitifully die for hunger and cold;
and as it is thought by the King's most humble and loving subjects that
one of the greatest occasions that moveth and provoketh those greedy and
covetous people so to accumulate and keep in their hands such great
portions and parties of the grounds and lands of this realm from the
occupying of the poor husbandmen, and so to use it in pasture and not in
tillage, is only the great profit that cometh of sheep, which now be
coming to a few persons' hands of this realm in respect of the whole
number of the King's subjects, that some have 24 thousand, some 20
thousand, and some more and some less, by which a good sheep for victual
that was accustomed to be sold for 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> at the most, is
now sold for 6<i>s.</i> 5<i>s.</i> or 4<i>s.</i> at the least; and a stone of clothing
wool that in some shires of this realm was accustomed to be sold for
18<i>d.</i> or 20<i>d.</i> is now sold for 4<i>s.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> at the least, and
in some countries where it hath been sold for 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> or 2<i>s.</i>, or
3<i>s.</i> at the most, it is now sold for 5<i>s.</i> or 4<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> at the least,
and so raised in every part of this realm; which things thus used be
principally to the high displeasure of Almighty God, to the decay of the
hospitality of this realm, to the diminishing of the King's people, and
to the hindrance of the clothmaking, whereby many poor people hath been
accustomed to be set on work, and in conclusion if remedy be not found
it may turn to the utter destruction and dislocation of this realm,
which God defend; it may therefore please the King's Highness of his
most gracious and godly disposition, and the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal of their goodness and charity, with the assent of the Commons
in this present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> parliament assembled, to ordain and enact by authority
of the same, that no person or persons from the feast of St. Michael the
Archangel which shall be in the year of Our Lord God 1535 shall keep
occupy or have in his possession in his own proper lands, nor in the
possession, lands or grounds of any other which he shall have or occupy
in farm, nor otherwise have of his own proper cattle in use, possession
or property, by any manner of means, fraud, craft or covyn, above the
number of 2,000 sheep at one time within any part of this realm of all
sorts and kinds, upon pain to lose and forfeit for every sheep that any
person or persons shall have or keep above the number limited by this
act, 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, the one half to the King our Sovereign Lord, and the
other half to such person as will sue for the same.... It is also
further enacted by authority aforesaid that no manner person after the

life, years or at will, by indenture, copy of court roll or otherwise,
any more houses, tenements of husbandry, whereunto any lands are

the number of two such holds or tenements; and that no manner person
shall have or occupy any such holds so newly taken to the number of two

<p>28 June, 1549.</p>

<p>An Order taken upon complaint made to the Lord Protector and other of
the King's Majesty's Privy Council for the town of Godmanchester.</p>

<p>First, all and every person within the said town having any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> more houses
of habitation than one in his possession, or any site of a house
whereupon a house of habitation hath been with [in] [<i>blank</i>] years
standing, shall at and before the Feast of St. Michael in the year of
our Lord God 1549 let or demise every the said house with the land
thereto accustomed, besides one, to a convenient person, if any that
shall require, upon the usual rent, and upon every site now having no
house of habitation shall before the said Feast of St. Michael in the
same year build a house for habitation and thereto allot so much as
thereto was heretofore belonging, and the same shall let and demise, if
any that will hire, upon the accustomed rent.</p>

<p>Item, every person having converted any house or habitation unto any
other use shall before Michaelmas next coming revert to the use of
habitation as it was before, and the same shall let to any which that
require upon the accustomed rent, and every person forthwith shall for
every house of habitation, decayed site of habitation, and for every
house of habitation converted to other use during the time of his
possession, maintain and keep the King's watch and other common charges
of the town in like manner as hath been heretofore of them used.</p>

<p>Item, whereas there is a great number of acres, lately belonging to
certain gilds there, it is ordered that the same shall be divided to the
inhabitants thereof in this manner; that is to say, to every ploughland
5 acres, and to every cottage or artificer there dwelling, or which
hereafter upon the houses to be new builded shall dwell, one acre; and
if the number do not extend, then every ploughland 4, and so for lack of
that rate every ploughland 3; and the residue of the said acres falling
after that rate to be divided amongst the cottages, paying for every of
the said acres 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> and above.</p>

<p>Item, also whereas there be certain groves of wood destroyed and turned
to pasture in the same town, every such grove being so altered shall be
by the owner thereof again (having been so altered within this 20 years
before Michaelmas next coming) enclosed and preserved for wood, saving
so much of the same to be reserved for a high way for the owner as in
those cases the like is there used, the same high way to be severed by
hedge from the rest of the grove; and where the groves be so destroyed
that there remaineth no hope of growth, the owner thereof shall before
the next season following meet for the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> set it with wood or sow it
with acorns or otherwise as the same may best be for growth of wood.</p>

<p>Provided nevertheless if any manner person have converted any house of
habitation or any site of habitation to his necessary use about his own
house, so that the same should be great inconvenience to be reverted to
the first and old use, then in that case the owner shall be discharged
if he for every such habitation so altered do build a like house in some
other convenient like place, and the same to use to all purposes as
before is said of the like.</p>

<p>The bailiffs be commanded to bring their grant by charter to the Lord
Protector at All Hallow tide next coming.</p>

<p>For the observation of which orders the bailiffs and others of that town
be bound in recognisance before the said Protector and Council.</p>

Eliz. c. 2, Statutes of the Realm, Vol. IV., Part II. pp. 893-96</i>],
1597-8.</p>

<p>Whereas the strength and flourishing estate of this kingdom hath been
always and is greatly upheld and advanced by the maintenance of the
plough and tillage, being the occasion of the increase and multiplying
of people both for service in the wars and in times of peace, being also
a principal means that people are set on work, and thereby withdrawn
from idleness, drunkenness, unlawful games and all other lewd practices
and conditions of life; and whereas by the same means of tillage and
husbandry the greater part of the subjects are preserved from extreme
poverty in a competent estate of maintenance and means to live, and the
wealth of the realm is kept dispersed and distributed in many hands,
where it is more ready to answer all necessary charges for the service
of the realm; and whereas also the said husbandry and tillage is a cause
that the realm doth more stand upon itself, without depending upon
foreign countries either for bringing in of corn in time of scarcity, or
for vent and utterance of our own com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>modities being in over great
abundance; and whereas from the 27th year of King Henry VIII of famous
memory, until the five and thirtieth year of Her Majesty's most happy
reign, there was always in force some law which did ordain a conversion
and continuance of a certain quantity and apportion of land in tillage
not to be altered; and that in the last parliament held in the said five
and thirtieth year of her Majesty's reign, partly by reason of the great
plenty and cheapness of grain at that time within this realm, and partly
by reason of the imperfection and obscurity of the law made in that
case, the same was discontinued; since which time there have grown many
more depopulations, by turning tillage into pasture, than at any time
for the like number of years heretofore: Be it enacted ... that whereas
any lands or grounds at any time since the seventeenth of November in
the first year of Her Majesty's reign have been converted to sheep
pastures or to the fattening or grazing of cattle, the same lands having
been tillable lands, fields or grounds such as have been used in tillage
by the space of twelve years together at the least next before such
conversion, according to the nature of the soil and course of husbandry
used in that part of the country, all such lands and grounds as
aforesaid shall, before the first day of May which shall be in the year
of Our Lord God 1599, be restored to tillage, or laid for tillage in
such sort as the whole ground, according to the nature of that soil and
course of husbandry used in that part of the country, be within three
years at the least turned to tillage by the occupiers and possessors
thereof, and so shall be continued for ever.</p>

<p>And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that all lands and
grounds which now are used in tillage or for tillage, having been
tillable lands, fields or grounds, such as next before the first day of
this present parliament have been by the space of twelve years together
at the least used in tillage or for tillage, according to the nature of
the soil and course of husbandry used in that part of the country, shall
not be converted to any sheep pasture or to the grazing or fattening of
cattle by the occupiers or possessors thereof, but shall, according to
the nature of that soil and course of husbandry used in that part of the
country, continue to be used in tillage or for tillage for corn or
grain, and not for waste.... And be it enacted by the authority
aforesaid, that if any person or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> body politic or corporate shall offend
against the premises, every such person or body politic or corporate so
offending shall lose and forfeit for every acre not restored or not
continued as aforesaid, the sum of twenty shillings for every year that
he or they so offend; and that the said penalties or forfeitures shall
be divided in three equal parts, whereof one third part to be to the
Queen's Majesty, her heirs and successors to her and their own use (and)
one other third part to the Queen's Majesty, her heirs and successors
for relief of the poor in the parish where the offence shall be
committed ... and the other third part to such person as will sue for
the same in any court of record at Westminster.... Provided also, that
this act shall not extend to any counties within this realm of England,
but such only as shall be hereafter specified; that is to say, the
counties of Northampton, Leicester, Warwick, Buckingham, Bedford,
Oxford, Berkshire, the Isle of Wight, Gloucester, Worcester, Nottingham,
Hampshire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset, Derby, Rutland, Lincoln,
Hereford, Cambridge, Huntingdon, York, Pembroke in South Wales, and the
Bishopric of Durham and Northumberland, and the counties of all the
cities and corporations lying situate and being within the counties
aforesaid, or confining to the same, and the Ainsty of the county of the
city of York.</p>


<p>18. <span class="smcap"><a name="Speech_in_House_of_Commons_on_Enclosures" id="Speech_in_House_of_Commons_on_Enclosures"></a>Speech in House of Commons on Enclosures</span> [<i>Hist. MSS. Com.
MSS. of Marquis of Salisbury, Part VII, pp. 541-3</i>], 1597<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>.</p>

<p>But now, as if all these wrongs should be redressed, and all the cries
and curses of the poor should be removed, it hath pleased you, Mr.
Speaker, to exhibit this bill to our view as a complete remedy. I will
not say 'it is worse than the disease.' But this I may truly say, 'It is
too weak for the disease!' Three things I find exactly and providently
respected. First, that the law is general, without exception, drawing in
the purchaser as well as the first offender, whereat, howsoever some may
shake their heads, as pressed with their own grief, yet is there no new
imposition charged upon them, but such as is grounded upon the common
law. For being without contra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>diction that this turning of the earth to
sloth and idleness, whereby it cannot fructify to the common good, is
the greatest and most dangerous nuisance and damage to the common
people, the law hath provided that the treasure of wickedness shall
profit nothing, but that the nuisance shall be reformed in the hands of
the people that come in upon the best consideration.... And 26 Eliz. in
the Exchequer, in Claypole's case, an exhibition was exhibited upon the
Statute of 4 Hen. VII<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> against a purchaser for converting of tillage
into pasture, and adjudged good, though the purchaser were not the
converter, but only a contriver of the first conversion. So as this new
law tends but for an explanation of the old, that every one by the eye
may be informed what ought by the hand to be amended. Nay, though it be
not fit, Mr. Speaker, to be published among the ruder sort, who, if they
were privy to their own strength and liberty allowed them by the law,
would be as unbridled and untamed beasts, yet is it not unfit to be
delivered in this place of council, that is, that where the wrong and
mischief spreads to an universality, there the people may be their own
justices, as in 6 Ed. II and 8 Ed. III Ass. 154 and 447 it is adjudged
that if a wall be raised atraverse the way that leadeth to the Church
all the parishioners may beat it down, and 9 Ed. IV 445, if the course
of a water that runs to a town be stopped or diverted all the
inhabitants may break it down. Are the people thus interested in the
Church wherein their souls are fed, and shall we not think them to be as
deeply interested in the corn and increase of the earth that feeds and
maintains their bodies? Therefore most wisely hath the gentleman that
penned the law pressed the case upon the purchaser that he plough, lest
the people plot to circumvent him.</p>

<p>The second thing so well provided is ... that it turns one eye backward
to cure the ancient complaints and old festered disease of dearth and
scarcity that hath been so long among us, and turns the other eye
forward to cut out, as it were, the core that might draw on hereafter
mischiefs of the same nature; where the gentleman that framed this bill
hath dealt like a most skilful chirurgien, not clapping on a plaster to
cover<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> the sore that it spread no further, but searching into the very
depths of the wound, that the life and strength which hath so long been
in decay by the wasting of towns and countries may at length again be
quickened and repaired.</p>

<p>The third thing most politicly respected is the intercourse and change
of ground to be converted into tillage, keeping a just proportion. For
it fareth with the earth as with other creatures that through continual
labour grow faint and feeble-hearted, and therefore, if it be so far
driven as to be out of breath, we may now by this law resort to a more
lusty and proud piece of ground while the first gathers strength, which
will be a means that the earth yearly shall be surcharged with burden of
her own excess. And this did the former lawmakers overslip, tyeing the
land once tilled to a perpetual bondage and servitude of being ever
tilled.</p>

<p>But this threefold benefit I find crossed and encountered with a
fourfold mildness and moderation fit to have a keen edge and sharpness
set upon it, wherein I acknowledge my master that drew this project to
have shewed himself like a tender-hearted physician, who coming to a
patient possessed and full of corrupt and evil humours, will not hastily
stir the body, but apply gentle and easy recipes. But surely, Mr.
Speaker, a desperate disease must have a desperate medicine, and some
wounds will not be healed but by incision.</p>

<p>The first moderation I mislike in this new law is that the most cunning
and skilful offender shall altogether slip the collar; for if a man have
decayed a whole town by enclosures, and hath rid his hand of it by
exchange with Her Majesty, taking from her ancient enclosed pastures
naturally yielding after the rate that his forced enclosed ground can
yield upon such corrupt improvement, and to justify the true value shall
take a lease back again of the Queen, the man is an occupier within the
words of this law. But by your favour, Mr. Speaker, not within the
intent of this law to plough this new enclosure, because Her Majesty is
in reversion, and this law doth not extend neither to her nor to her
farmers. And that none might escape it were good that all of this kind
might be enforced either to a contribution toward the poor,<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> who are
chiefly wronged, or to the breaking up of the grounds he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> received from
Her Majesty because they come in lieu of the former.</p>

<p>The second moderation that would be amended is in the imposition of the
pain ... which is but 10<i>s.</i> yearly for every acre not converted. By
your favour, Mr. Speaker, it is too easy: and I will tell you, Sir, the
ears of our great sheep-masters do hang at the door of this house, and
myself have heard since this matter grew in question to be reformed,
that some, enquiring and understanding the truths of the penalty, have
prepared themselves to adventure 10<i>s.</i> upon the certainty of the gain
of 30<i>s.</i> at the least. The third moderation is in the exception that
exempts grounds mown for hay to be converted into tillage. And, if it
please you, Sir, the first resolutions our enclosed gentlemen have is to
sort and proportion their grounds into two divisions, the one for walks
whereon their sheep may feed in the fresh summer, the other for hay
whereon their sheep may feed in the hard winter; so that these grounds
that carry hay have been as oil to keep the fire flaming and therefore
no reason why they should be shielded and protected from the
ploughshare.</p>

<p>The fourth moderation is that after this reconversion there is no
restraint, but that every one may keep all the land ploughed in his own
hands; whereupon will follow that as now there is scarcity of corn and
plenty of such as would be owners, so then there will be plenty of corn,
but scarcity of such as can be owners. For until our gentlemen that now
enclose much, and then must plough much, shall meet with more compassion
toward the poor than they have done, their small will be as small as it
hath been, and then every one will be either an engrosser under false
pretence of large housekeeping, or else a transporter by virtue of some
license he will hope to purchase. And therefore it were good that every
one should be rated how much he should keep in his own hands, and that
not after the proportions of his present estimation; as, if a man hath
lifted up his countenance by reason of this unnatural and cruel
improvement after the rate of a gentleman of a thousand pounds by year,
where the same quantity of land before would yield but a hundred pounds
by year, I would have this man ruled after his old reckoning....</p>

<p>We sit now in judgment over ourselves: therefore as this bill entered at
first with a short prayer 'God speed the plough.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> so I wish it may end
with such success as the plough may speed the poor.</p>

<p>The points to be considered of in the continuance of Statutes were read,
and offered still to dispute whether the Statute of Tillage should be
continued.</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson said, In the time of Dearth, when we made this statute, it
was not considered that the hand of God was upon us; and now corn is
cheap; if too cheap, the Husbandman is undone, whom we must provide for,
for he is the staple man of the kingdom. And so after many arguments he
concluded the Statute to be repealed.</p>

<p>Mr. Bacon said the old commendation of Italy by the Poet was <i>potens
viris atque ubere glebae</i>, and it stands not with the policy of the
State that the wealth of the kingdom should be engrossed into a few
graziers' hands. And if you will put in so many provisoes as be desired,
you will make it useless. The Husbandman is a strong and hardy man, the
good footman. Which is a chief observation of good warriors, etc. So he
concluded the statutes not to be repealed.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Raleigh said, I think the law fit to be repealed; for many
poor men are not able to find seed to sow so much as they are bound to
plough, which they must do, or incur the penalty of the law. Besides,
all nations abound with corn. France offered the Queen to serve Ireland
with corn for 16<i>s.</i> a quarter, which is but 2<i>s.</i> the bushel; if we
should sell it so here, the ploughman would be beggared. The low
countryman and the Hollander, which never soweth corn, hath by his
industry such plenty that they will serve other nations. The Spaniard,
who often wanteth corn, had we never so much plenty, will not be
beholding to the Englishman for it....</p>

<p>And therefore I think the best course is to set it at liberty, and leave
every man free, which is the desire of a true Englishman.</p>

<p>Mr. Secretary Cecil said, I do not dwell in the country. I am not
acquainted with the plough. But I think that whosoever doth not maintain
the plough destroys this king<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>dom.... My motion therefore shall be that
this law may not be repealed, except former laws may be in force and
revived. Say that a glut of corn should be, have we not sufficient
remedy by transportation, which is allowable by the policy of all
nations?... I am sure when warrants go from the Council for levying of
men in the countries, and the certificates be returned unto us again, we
find the greatest part of them to be ploughmen. And excepting Sir Thomas
More's Utopia, or some such feigned commonwealth, you shall never find
but the ploughman is chiefly provided for, the neglect whereof will not
only bring a general, but a particular damage to every man.... If we
debar tillage, we give scope to the depopulator; and then if the poor
being thrust out of their houses go to dwell with others, straight we
catch them with the Statute of Inmates; if they wander abroad they are
within danger of the Statute of the Poor to be whipped.</p>

Depopulation</span> [<i>S.P.D. Charles I, Vol. 497, No. 10</i>], 1641.</p>

<p>That upon the Commission of enquiry after depopulation, the Lord
Archbishop of Canterbury and other the Commissioners, at the
solicitation of Tho. Hussey, gent, did direct a letter in nature of a
Commission to certain persons within the County of Wilts, to certify
what number of acres in South Marston in the parish of Highworth were
converted from arable to pasture, and what number of ploughs were laid
down, etc.</p>

<p>Whereupon the Archdeacon with two others did return certificate, to the
Lord Archbishop, etc.</p>

<p>Upon this certificate, Mr. Anth. Hungerford, Mr. Southby, with 15
others, were convented before his Grace and the other Commissioners at
the Council Board, where, being charged with conversion;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Anth. Hungerford and Mr. Southby with some others did aver that they
had made no conversion, other than they had when they came to be owners
thereof.</p>

<p>His Grace said that they were to look no further than to the owners. And
certificate was returned that so many acres were converted and so many
ploughs let down.</p>

<p>They alleged that this certificate was false and made without their
privity, and therefore Mr. Hungerford in the behalf of the rest did
desire that they might not be judged upon that certificate; but that
they might have the like favour as Mr. Hussey had, to have certificates
of the same nature directed to other Commissioners, or a Commission, if
it might be granted, to examine upon oath whereby the truth might better
appear.</p>

<p>His Grace replied to Mr. Hungerford, "Since you desire it and are so
earnest for it you shall not have it."<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>They did offer to make proof that since the conversion there were more
habitations of men of ability and fewer poor, and that whereas the King

"And the revenue of too many of the Court consisted principally in
enclosures, and improvements of that nature, which he [<i>i.e</i>., Laud],
still opposed passionately except they were founded upon law; and then,
if it would bring profit to the King, how old and obsolete soever the
law was, he thought he might justly advise the prosecution. And so he
did a little too much countenance the Commission for Depopulation, which
brought much charge and trouble upon the people, which was likewise cast

<p>The documents in this section illustrate certain aspects of the life of
towns and gilds from 1485-1660. In the first half of the sixteenth
century two important changes in the legal position of gilds were made
by Act of Parliament, (i) Owing to the growing complaints of their
exclusiveness (Nos. 1 and 6). Parliament had already by 15 Hen. VI, c.
6, and 19 Hen. VII, c. 7, compelled gilds to submit their ordinances to
the approval of extra-municipal authorities before they became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> valid
(Nos. 6 and 17). By 22 Hen. VIII it fixed 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> as the maximum fee
to be charged persons entering and 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> as the maximum fee for
persons leaving their apprenticeship. By 28 Hen. VIII c. 5 it forbad
restrictive agreements designed to prevent apprentices or journeymen
starting in trade on their own account (No. 6). (ii.) By 37 Hen. VIII c.
4 and 1 Ed. VI. c. 14 (No. 7) Parliament confiscated for the benefit of
the Crown that part of gild property which was applied to religious
purposes. The latter Act was, however, strongly opposed in the House of
Commons, and the confiscated estates were restored to two towns,
Coventry and King's Lynn (No. 8).</p>

<p>Apart from these changes towns and gilds pursued in the sixteenth
century much the same economic policy as in earlier ages. They imposed
inter-municipal tariffs (No. 2), and regulated markets (Nos. 4 and 12),
wages (Nos. 3, 5, and 13), apprenticeship and the entry into trades
(Nos. 1, 9, 10, 11, 15) on high moral grounds (No. 10), but sometimes
with consequences unpleasant to those who were excluded (Nos. 1 and 15).
Indeed their anxiety to preserve their monopoly occasionally brought
them into conflict with the law, which "abhors all monopolies" (No. 18).
Inside the gilds, however, a momentous change was going on. The
fifteenth century had seen the rise within gilds of "yeomanry"
organizations consisting of journeymen, of which an example is given
below (No. 14, and Part I, Section V, No. 16). In the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries the gilds, at least in the larger towns,
represented a wide range of interests, from the mercantile capitalist to
the industrial small master, and it was often of such small masters,
whose numbers appear to have increased in the sixteenth century, that
the "yeomanry" then consisted (No. 16). They tended, however, to be at
the mercy of the large capitalists, and occasionally under the first two
Stuarts, who favoured them, they endeavoured to protect themselves by
joint-stock enterprise (No. 17). In the middle of the seventeenth
century a reverse movement was taking place. Small masters were becoming
journeymen, and in London journeymen were engaged under the Commonwealth
in active<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> agitation. Their organization was that of an embryo trade
union; their doctrine the application to industrial affairs of the
theory of the social contract (No. 19).</p>

<p>Where in the parliament begun at London the third of November in the
21st year of the reign of our most dread Lord King Henry the eight, and
from thence adjourned and prorogued to Westminster the 16 day of January
in the 22 year of the reign of our said Sovereign Lord and there then
also holden, it was and it is recited, that where before that time it
was established and enacted in the 19 year of our late Sovereign Lord
King Henry the VIIth, that no masters, warden and fellowship of crafts,
or any of them, nor any rulers of guilds or fraternities, should take
upon them any acts or ordinances nor to execute any acts or ordinances
by them before that time made or then hereafter to be made, in
disheritance or diminution of the prerogative of the King nor of other
nor against the common profit of the people, but if the same acts or
ordin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>ances were examined or approved by the chancellor, treasurer of
England or chief justice of either bench or 3 of them, or before the
justices of assize in their circuit or progress in the shire where such
acts or ordinances be made, upon pain of forfeiture of &pound;40 for every
time that they do the contrary, as more plainly in the said act doth
appear; since which time divers wardens and fellowships have made acts
and ordinances, that every apprentice should pay at his first entry in
their common hall to the wardens of the same fellowship some of them
40<i>s.</i>, some 30<i>s.</i>, some 20<i>s.</i>, some 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, some 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>,
some 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> after their own sinister minds and pleasure, contrary
to the meaning of the said act made in the said 19 year of the reign of
the said late King Henry the VIIth and to the great hurt of the King's
true subjects putting their children to be apprentices: It was therefore
in the said parliament holden at Westminster in the said 22 year of the
reign of King Henry the eight, established and enacted by the King our
Sovereign Lord by the advice of his Lords, Spiritual and Temporal, and
of the Commons in the same parliament assembled and by the authority of
the same, that no master, wardens or fellowships of crafts or masters or
any of them, nor any rulers of fraternities should take from thenceforth
of any apprentice or of any other person or persons for the entry of any
apprentice into their said fellowship above the sum of 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, nor
for his entry when his years and term is expired and ended, above 3<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i> upon pain of forfeiture of &pound;40 for every time that they do to the
contrary.... Since which said several acts established and made (as is
aforesaid), divers masters, wardens and fellowships of crafts have by
cautell and subtil means compassed and practised to defraud and delude
the said good and wholesome statutes, causing divers apprentices or
young men immediately after their years be expired, or that they may be
made free of their occupation or fellowship, to be sworn upon the Holy
Evangelist at their first entry that they nor any of them after their
years or term expired shall not set up or open any shop, house nor
[cellar] nor occupy as free men, without the assent and licence of the
master, wardens or fellowships of their occupations, upon pain of
forfeiting their freedom or other like penalty; by reason whereof the
said apprentices and journeymen be put to as much or more charges
thereby than they beforetime were put unto for the obtaining and
entering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> of their freedom, to the great hurt and impoverishment of the
said apprentices and journeymen and other their friends; For remedy
whereof be it now by the authority of this present parliament
established, ordained and enacted, that no master, wardens or
fellowships of crafts nor any of them, nor any rulers of guilds
fraternities or brotherhoods, from henceforth compel or cause any
apprentice or journeyman, by oath or bond heretofore made or hereafter
to be made or otherwise, that he after his apprenticeship or term
expired, shall not set up nor keep any shop house nor cellar, nor occupy
as a freeman without licence of the masters, wardens or fellowships of
his or their occupation for and concerning the same; nor by any means
exact or take of any such apprentices or journeyman nor any other
occupying for themselves, nor of any other persons for them, after his
or their said years expired, any sum of money or other things for or
concerning his or their freedom or occupation, otherwise or in any other
manner than before is recited limited and appointed in the said former
act made in the said 22 year of the reign of King Henry the eight; upon
the pain to forfeit for every time that they or any of them shall offend

confiscation of that part of the property of gilds which was devoted to
religious purposes. The Act printed above was a re-enactment with some
important variations of an Act of 1545 (37 Hen. VIII, c. 4). For its
object and effect see Ashley, <i>Economic History</i>, Vol. I, part II, pp.
142-145, and pp. 184-187, who gives reasons for disagreeing with the
statement of Thorold Rogers (<i>Six Centuries of Work and Wages</i>, pp.

that the Act "suppressed" the craft gilds; Pollard, <i>The Political
History of England</i> 1547-1603, pp. 17-20 ("the greatest educational
opportunity in English history was lost, and the interests of the nation
were sacrificed to those of its aristocracy"); Leach, <i>English Schools

bitterly of the use to which the confiscated property was put. "For in
suppressing of abbeys, cloisters, colleges, and chantries, the intent of
the King's Majesty that dead is, was, and of this our King now is, very
godly.... Howbeit covetous officers have so used this matter that even
those goods which did serve to the relief of the poor, the maintenance
of learning, and to comfortable necessary hospitality in the
Commonwealth, be now turned to maintain worldly, wicked, covetous
ambition." ... "Your Majesty hath had given and received by Act of
Parliament, colleges, chantries, and gilds for many good considerations,
and especially, as appeareth in the same Act, for erecting of grammar
schools to the education of youth in virtue and godliness, to the
further augmenting of the Universities, and better provision for the
poor and needy. But now many grammar schools, and much charitable
provision for the poor be taken, sold, and made away, to the great
slander of you and your laws, to the utter discomfort of the poor, to
the grievous offence of the people, to the most miserable drowning of
youth in ignorance, and for decay of the Universities."</p></div>

1548.</p>


<p style="margin-left: 2em;">At Westminster, Sunday, the vith of May, 1548</p>

<p>Whereas in the last parliament, holden at Westminster in November, the
first year of the King's Majesty's reign, among other articles contained
in the act for colleges and chantry lands, etc., to be given unto his
Highness, it was also inserted that the lands pertaining to all guilds
and brotherhoods within this realm should pass unto his Majesty by way
of like gift, at which time divers then being of the lower house did not
only reason and argue against that article made for the guildable lands,
but also incensed many others to hold with them, among the which none
were stiffer nor more busily went about to impugn the said articles than
the burgesses for the town of Lynn, in the county of Norfolk, and the
burgesses of the city of Coventry, in the county of Warwick; the
burgesses of Lynn alleging that the guild lands belonging to their said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
town were given for so good a purpose (that is to say, for the
maintenance and keeping up of the pier and seabanks there, which being
untended to would be the loss of a great deal of low ground of the
country adjoining), as it were great pity the same should be alienated
from them as long as they employed it to so necessary an use; and
semblably they of Coventry declaring that where that city was of much
fame and antiquity, some times very wealthy though now of late years
brought into decay and poverty, and had not to the furniture of the
whole multitude of the Commons there, being to the number of xi or xii
thousand housling people, but two churches wherein God's service is
done, whereof the one, that is to say, the church of Corpus Christi, was
specially maintained of the revenues of such guild lands lying only in
houses and tenements within the town as had been given heretofore by
diverse persons to that use and others no less beneficial to the
supporting of that city; if therefore now by the act the same lands
should pass from them it should be a manifest cause of the utter
desolation of the city, as long as the people, when the churches were no
longer supported, nor God's service done therein, and the other uses and
employments of those lands omitted, should be of force constrained to
abandon the city and seek new dwelling places, which should be more loss
unto the King's Majesty by losing so [much] of the yearly fee farm
there, and subversion of so notable a town, than the accruing of a sort
of old houses and cottages pertaining to the guilds and chantries of the
said cities, should be of value or profit to his Majesty, as long as his
Highness should be at more cost with the reparations of the same than
the yearly rents would amount unto.</p>

<p>In respect of which their allegations and great labour made herein unto
the House, such of his Highness Council as were of the same House there
present thought it very likely and apparent that not only that article
for the guildable lands should be dashed, but also that the whole body
of the act might either sustain peril or hindrance being already
engrossed, and the time of the Parliament Prorogation hard at hand,
unless by some good policy the principal speakers against the passing of
that article might be stayed; whereupon they did anticipate this matter
with the Lord Protector's Grace and others of the Lords of his Highness
Council, who, pondering on the one part how the guildable lands
throughout this realm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> amounted to no small yearly value, which by the
article aforesaid were to be accrued to his Majesty's possessions of the
Crown; and on the other part weighing in a multitude of free voices what
moment the labour of a few setters on had been of heretofore in like
cases, thought it better to stay and content them of Lynn and Coventry
by granting to them to have and enjoy their guild lands, etc., as they
did before, than through their means, on whose importune labour and
suggestion the great part of the Lower House rested, to have the article
defaced, and so his Majesty to forego the whole guild lands throughout
the realm; and for these respects and also for avoiding of the proviso
which the said burgesses would have had added for the guilds to this
article, which might have ministered occasion to others to have laboured
for the like, they resolved that certain of his Highness' Councillors
being of the Lower House should persuade with the said burgesses of Lynn
and Coventry to desist from further speaking or labouring against the
said article, upon promise to them that if they meddled no further
against it, his Majesty, once having the guildable lands granted unto
him by the act as it was penned unto him, should make them over a new
grant of the lands pertaining then unto their guilds, etc., to be had
and used to them as afore. Which thing the said Councillors did execute
as was devised, and thereby stayed the speakers against it, so as the
act passed with the clause for guildable lands accordingly.</p>

<p>And now seeing that the Mayors and others of the said city of Coventry
and town of Lynn by reason of that promise so made unto them have humbly
made suit unto the Lord Protector's Grace and Council aforesaid that the
same may be performed unto them, which promise his Grace and the said
Council do think that his Highness is bound in honour to observe,
although it were not so that indeed those lands which belonged to the
guild at Lynn cannot well be taken from them, being so allotted and
employed to the maintenance of the pier and seabanks there, which of
necessity as was alleged, require daily reparations, no more than the
guild and chantry lands at Coventry upon the foresaid considerations
could conveniently (as was thought) be taken from them without putting
the said city to apparent danger of desolation; it was therefore this
day ordained, and by the accord and assent of the Lord Protector's Grace
and others of his Highness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> Council decreed, that letters patents should
be made in due form under the King's Majesty's Great Seal of England
whereby the said guild lands belonging to the two churches at Coventry
should be newly granted unto them of the city for ever, and the lands
lately pertaining to the guild of Lynn also granted unto that town for
ever, to be used to such like purpose and intent as aforetimes by force
of their grants they were limited to do accordingly.</p>

to Prevent the Brewers Taking their Trade</span> [<i>Hist. MSS. Com,

<p>Whereas, as well in ancient time as now of late days, good and wholesome
laws have been by the State of this realm devised, ordained, and enacted
for the better maintenance of the subjects of the same; amongst which
laws it is ordained how each sort of people, being handicraftsmen or of
occupation, should use the trade and living wherein they have been
lawfully trained up and served for the same as the said laws do appoint;
nevertheless, it may please your worships, divers persons do seek unto
themselves by sinister ways and contrary to those good laws certain
trades to live by, and not only to live by but inordinately to gain, to
the utter overthrow of their neighbours which have lawfully used those
occupations, and served for the same according to the said laws. Amongst
which sort of people certain of the brewers of this town use the trade
and occupation of bakers, not having been apprentices to the same, nor
so lawfully served in the same trade as they thereby may justly
challenge to use the said occupation of baking, to the utter
impoverishment of the bakers of the said town, their wives, children,
and families, and contrary to the law, equity, and good conscience;
whereby we whose names are underwritten shall be constrained to give
over, and for themselves to seek some other means to live, and to leave
our wives and children, if in time remedy be not provided by your
worships for the same.    <span style="margin-left: 25em;">James Welles.</span><br />

concerning the Preceding Petition</span> [<i>ibid., pp. 47-8</i>], 1575.</p>

<p>Upon the lamentable complaint of our poor neighbours the bakers, we did
with good and long deliberation consider of their cause, and finding
that their decay is such as without speedy reformation they shall not
have wherewith to maintain their wives, children, and family, which are
not few in number, a thing in conscience to be lamented, and we for
remission in duty to be greatly blamed; and since the overthrow of these
poor men is happened by reason of the brewers (who ought by the laws of
this realm not to be bakers also) have by our sufferance (but the rather
for that Robert Jackson is towards your Lordship) used both to bake and
brew of long time, whereby Robert Jackson (God be thanked) is grown to
good wealth, and the whole company of the bakers thereby utterly
impoverished, and finding that by no reasonable persuasion from us,
neither with the lamentable complaint of the bakers, those brewers would
leave baking, we were driven by justice and conscience to provide for
their relief the speedier. Whereupon we did, with consent of Mayor,
Jurats, and Common Council, make a certain decree, lawful, as we think,
for the better maintenance of them, their wives, children and family, a
matter in civil government worth looking into when the state of a common
weal is preferred before the private gain of a few, which decree we
required Mr. Gaymer to acquaint your Honour with, at his last being with
you, who upon his return advertised us that your Lordship had the view
thereof, and also of your Honour's well liking of the same, humbly
beseeching your good Lordship's aid and continuance therein, whereof we
have no doubt, being a matter that doth concern (and that according to
the laws of the realm) the relief of those who are brought to the brink
of decay.</p>

<p>Thos. Machyn, Mayor of the City of Gloucester, to all to whom, etc. Know
ye that there came this day into the Court of the aldermen there divers
of the journeymen weavers of the said city in the name of their whole
fellowship of journeymen, and signified by their petition that whereas
before this time sundry good ordinances have been made and granted by,
and agreed upon by and between the master weavers of the said city,
known by the name of the Warden and Fraternity of St. Anne of the
weavers in the town of Gloucester, and the said journeymen, for the good
order and government of man and for their better relief; and some disuse
of the same has been of late years through the negligence of some of the
said journeymen, and upon this untrue intendment that some of the said
ordinances were not warrantable by the laws of this realm, nor
convenient for the public good of the said city; it has therefore seemed
fit to us, the Mayor and Aldermen, not only thoroughly to consider the
said articles, but also to consider such books of compositions as have
been heretofore given to the said company or fraternity of weavers,
either by our predecessors or by the justices of assize of the county of
the city; we have therefore called before us the Wardens and Stewards of
the said fraternity or company to hear what they could or would say
thereupon for our better information, requiring them further to shew us
their books of compositions; who very willingly and orderly brought
before us the several books hereafter mentioned; one book approved by
the Justices of Assize, dated 10 Nov., 24 Henry VII, another book
granted by our predecessors, also allowed by the Justices of Assize,
dated 13 March, 4 Edward VI. We, having fully considered the said books,
are pleased, with the consent of the present Warden and Stewards of the
said Company of Weavers and of others the masters of the said Company
occupying the trade of weaving within the said city, to allow that the
journeymen of the said trade in the said city may in quiet and orderly
sort at any time hereafter congregate and meet together at any fit place
within the said city and such time of the day, between the hours of
seven of the clock in the forenoon and four of the clock in the
afternoon, as to them shall be thought fit and con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>venient, ever giving
notice to the Warden of the said Company of weavers or, in his absence,
to one of the stewards of the said fraternity one day before, at the
least, of their meaning and purpose to meet, to the intent that if the
said Warden or any of the said Company of the master weavers shall think
or know anything meet to be considered of and conferred of between them,
that the same might be proposed and so concluded of as might stand with
equity and good order, and to the end that a quiet and peaceable
demeanour with orderly and civil usage may be by and among the said
whole company of journeymen at all times hereafter observed, and that
the one to the other of them may give that brotherly aid and Christian
relief as best may be for their helps, some of them being young men and
bachelors having neither houses of their own or family, and some others
of great years burdened with the charge of wife and many children; it is
therefore thought good by us, with the assent of the said
master-weavers, that they the said journeymen shall and lawfully may
yearly, on the day of Saint Peter the Apostle, meet together and choose
two honest and discreet journeymen of the elder and discreetest sort of
them to be their Stewards for the year ensuing, which Stewards shall
have power and authority to assemble and call together all the
journeymen of the said art or others whatsoever professing and using the
trade of weaving in the said city or suburbs of the same not being
masters, and they so being assembled to confer among themselves of all
such good means and orders as best may be for the good of their society
and to the only ends and purposes before mentioned; which said
journeymen being so chosen shall take upon them the said office of
Stewardship and shall execute all and singular the following ordinances,
either of them refusing the said office to forfeit 40<i>s.</i>; and the said
Stewards shall be yearly presented on St. Ann's day by six of the elder
and better sort of their Company of journeymen unto the Warden and
Stewards of the said Company of Weavers at such time and place as shall
be by them appointed, there to understand what to them doth pertain as
servants of the said trade of weaving, or by virtue of their composition
or grants made heretofore, or hereafter to be made, etc., all of which
they shall faithfully promise by giving of their hands to perform and
cause to be performed, on pain of 20<i>s.</i></p>

to produce a certificate of apprenticeship and testimony of good
behaviour, and to pay on admission 8<i>d.</i> to the fellowship of

to pay 1<i>d.</i> per quarter "to the relief of the poorer sort of the said

<p>To the worshipful master mayor and his brethren.</p>

<p>Be it known, Right Worshipful, that we be a certain number of poor
weavers who do use our trade within this town of Nottingham, thereby to
maintain ourselves our wives and children, according to the laws of God
and the King's Majesty's laws. It is not unknown unto your worship how
the burgess weavers have sought, and at this present do seek, to put us
down from working, thereby to work the utter undoing of us and of our
poor families. We humbly do entreat your Worships' favours with equity
to consider of our poor estates, who do not offend them nor work within
their freedom or composition, if they have any. Your Worships may
understand they do trouble us more of malice than for any hindrance they
receive by us, for that we see men of other trades, both in this
corporation and others, not being burgesses, yet work in manner as we
do, unmolested or troubled. Therefore we beseech your Worships that we
may have liberty to use our trades for the maintenance of ourselves, our
wives, and children, and if there be anything due either to Master Mayor
or any of his Worships' officers we are ready to discharge it; but as
for the weavers, we know no reason or authority they have to claim
anything of us, neither do we find ourselves able to bear so heavy a
burden as they would lay upon us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

the full agreement of those of the assistants and livery of the Company
being of the handicraft, the Wardens of the Yeomanry, their assistants
and xxiiij more of the said yeomanry, it was by this Court fully ordered

<p>January 16, 1610-11. The humble suit of your worships servants of the
yeomanry.</p>

<p>First, we entreat your worship that the upper Warden of the Yeomanry's
account may be yearly audited according to an old custom carefully
provided for by your worships predecessors, (that is to say) by two from
your worships Court of Assistants and two of our Ancients of the
yeomanry.</p>

<p>Secondly, we humbly entreat your worship that the remainder of the
quarterage, your worships' officers being paid, may remain in the
yeomanry's chest according to an old custom, our worshipful Master of
this Company for the time being to keep one key, the upper Wardens of
the Yeomanry to keep another key, and one of the Ancients of the
Assistants of the Yeomanry to keep the third key.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we desire of your worship that the upper warden of the yeomanry
may have one of his Ancients last being in his place to sit by him and
assist him in his accompts and to show him wherein the Company is
wronged.</p>

<p>Fourthly, we desire that when we shall find our officer of the yeomanry
to be slack and remiss in doing of his duty in his service which he
ought to do for the good of the Company, and the same duly proved
against him, that we of the yeomanry may have full authority to dismiss
him at our own discretion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> but not without the consent of the Master
and Wardens and Assistants of this Company for the time being first had
and obtained in that behalf.</p>

<p>These Petitions and requests of the yeomanry were granted and agreed
upon by the Master, Wardens and Assistants present at the said court
holden the said sixteenth day of January 1610 aforesaid.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>June 13, 1627. Whereas ... Suit was commenced in Court of King's Bench
at Westminster by the Wardens of Yeomanry in the name of Master and
Wardens against divers Merchant Adventurers upon viii Elizabeth, which
yet dependeth in the said court undetermined, and the said Wardens of
Yeomanry considering that the proceedings in like suits formerly
commenced have been stopped by some special command of the King and
State upon the solicitation of the said Merchant Adventurers being
strong in purse and friends, have bethought themselves of a way or mean
to prevent the said Merchant Adventurers from the like, and to that
purpose have dealt with a Gentleman named Mr. George Kirke of the King's
Majesty's Bedchamber, very gracious with his Majesty, who for a fourth
part of this moiety of all penalties, forfeitures which shall be
obtained or gotten upon any recovery to be had against any of the said
Merchant Adventurers upon any action or suit brought or to be brought,
sued, commenced, etc., hath undertaken to do his best and to use all the
credit and means he can to his Majesty that there be no stop or stay in
course of law for the solicitation or procurement of the said Merchant
Adventurers in suits already brought or to be brought.</p>

Titus B.V. 117</i>], <i>c.</i> 1611.</p>

<p>The state of the Feltmakers' Case, with some propositions on their part
to remedy the mischiefs they now are constrained to endure.</p>

<p>The feltmakers were by decrees in Star Chamber united to the Company of
the Haberdashers, London, and did sit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span> with them in their hall for
government of the trade, till they, finding themselves rather oppressed
by them than any way cherished or abuses reformed, thereupon by suit
obtained a charter from his Majesty by which they were incorporated a
body of themselves by the name of Master, Wardens and Commonalty of the
Art and Mystery of Feltmakers of London and 4 miles compass.</p>

<p>Hereupon by allowance of the Lord Mayor they published their charter,
took them a hall, and accordingly did and do govern their company.
Afterwards considering that they were a trade and company of themselves
by whom many thousands do live besides their company, namely, the hat
trimmers, band makers, hat dyers and hat sellers, which are the
haberdashers, and yet nevertheless they were extremely kept under by the
haberdashers engrossing the commodity of wools brought in merely for
their trade of hatmaking and for no other use, and by that means having
both the means of the feltmakers' trade (for wool) and the means of
their maintenance (for buying their wares being made) all in their
power, by which the feltmakers in general (except some few in
particular) do find themselves much wronged, and by means of it and
their daily threats did fear the overthrow of their trade: whereupon the
generality petitioning to the company of the hard case they lived in,
notwithstanding their extreme sore labour, besought them to provide some
means for their relief and prevention of what might ensue. The company
then by means made them a stock to buy the wools imported for the
company at the best hand; but being opposed by the haberdashers, the
prices by that means were enhanced, and yet the sale of their wares made
kept in bondage as before, whereby many of their trade have been
impoverished, many forced to leave their trade, and many to forsake the
city, by which means all that now live of feltmaking as pickers,
carders, trimmers, bandmakers, dyers and hatsellers are much hindered,
the trade being drawn into the country.</p>

<p>Hereupon the company became (as often before) humble suitors for their
freedom, which by opposition of the Company of Haberdashers and their
false suggestions to the court, they could not obtain&mdash;howbeit a
Committee of Aldermen have certified it to be fit&mdash;neither are suffered
to have liberty to search for the abuses of their trade under warrant
from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span> Lord Mayor, which formerly they have often done; besides,
their shops threatened to be shut up, notwithstanding their inhabiting
of the city many years.</p>

<p>Now the company seeing the extreme malice of the haberdashers, and that
the sale of their wares lieth solely in them, whereby many are forced to
hawk their hats made contrary to the statutes, and sell at far less
rates than they can truly afford them, only to buy victual, whereby if
some redress be not had many will be undone or forced to go into the
country, to the great damage of the trade in general and overthrow of
the corporation which they much desire to support: they have considered
to raise them a stock to take in all men's wares when they be made, to
avoid hawking, and to encourage men to follow their trade and continue
within the corporation, for the benefit of all parties, the city, the
trade and company, and all that trim and sell hats and live by that
trade, without desire of enhancing the price of anything or damage to
any man.</p>

<p>The stock they purpose to be 25,000<i>l.</i>, to be resident in some
convenient place of the suburbs, where men may take notice to have money
for their wares if they will bring them, being made good and at such
rates as they may well be afforded, by judgment of sworn men of the
trade, who shall rate them both inward and outward, so as the poor shall
sell much better than they have done the other sort, howbeit they sell
cheaper by 2<i>s.</i> in the pound than for the most part they have done; yet
having a certain market and ready money to buy wool again; and, in that
then they shall be in no hazard of loss by trusting, as now they do,
their gain will be much more.</p>

<p>1. The corporation will flourish.</p>

<p>2. Felts will be better made in that every man shall have price for his
ware as his workmanship is.</p>

<p>3. The trade, being much used in the country, will revert into the city,
to the benefit of the city and all that live by the trade.</p>

<p>4. The haberdasher shall buy good wares more generally than now and at
as cheap rates as he now usually buyeth (the times of the year and
prices of wool considered), and be sorted with much more ease and
content than now he is.</p>

<p>5. The haberdasher of mean estate shall be in much better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> case than
now, for that every man shall have good wares without culling according
to their sorts.</p>

<p>6. The commonwealth shall be better served in that now they shall have
good wares for their money.</p>

<p>7. The stock cannot but be gainful to the stockers, in that the hats,
according to their goodness, shall come in at 2<i>s.</i> in the pound profit
upon the sale, merely out of the feltmaker's labour, who is equally
benefited by the certain stock. Besides, the often return of the stock
at 2<i>s.</i> in the pound cannot but give content to the stockers.</p>

<p>8. The stock shall be sufficiently secured were it never so much, in
that they shall deliver no money without a sufficient value of wares.
Their sale will be certain in that without buying the haberdashers
cannot uphold their trade. Besides, no man shall have benefit of the
stock except he will bring all the ware he makes to it (except it be a
hat or two specially made, and that with the privilege of the stockers).
Besides, if at any time the stock shall be full of ware and want money,
the company by a general consent can forbear bringing in or slack their
making for a time. But so it is that once in a year all felts will off,
of what nature soever.</p>

<p>9. The wares being of necessity to be bought, the stockers will need not
trust except they will but upon good security, which will make men more
wary in buying.</p>

Part XI, pp. 53-55</i>], 1615.</p>

<p>Trin. II, Jac. Reg. King's Bench.</p>

<p>[The Master, Wardens, and Community of the Tailors and Workers of cloth
of the town of Ipswich in the County of Suffolk brought an action for
13<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> against William Sheninge. They allege</p>

<p>(i) that by the letters patent incorporating them they had power to make
reasonable rules and ordinances and to impose fines for breach of them;</p>

<p>(ii) that they had made a rule that no person occupying any of the said
trades in Ipswich should keep any shop or chamber, or exercise the said
faculties, or any of them, or take an apprentice or journeyman, till he
should present himself to the Master and Wardens of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>said society,
should prove that he had served an apprenticeship, and should be
admitted as a sufficient workman, on pain of 5 marks fine;</p>

<p>(iii) that in accordance with 19 Hen. vii., cap. 7, they had submitted
these rules to the justices of assize, who had allowed them;</p>

<p>(iv) that William Sheninge had worked 20 days as a tailor without
complying.</p>

<p>The defendant pleaded he was an apprentice by the space of 7 years, that
he had been retained as domestic servant for a year and that as such he
made garments for him, his wife, and children, which is the same use and
exercise wherein the plaintiffs demur.]</p>

<p>And in this case upon argument at the Bar and Bench, divers points were
resolved&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That at the Common Law no man could be prohibited from working in any
lawful trade, for the law abhors idleness ... and especially in young
men, who ought in their youth ... to learn lawful trades and sciences
which are profitable to the common weal.... And therefore the law abhors
all monopolies, which prohibit any from working in any lawful trade. And
that appears in 2 H. 5, 56. A dyer was bound that he should not use the
dyers' craft for 2 years, and there Hull holds that the bond was against
the common law, and by God if the plaintiff was here he should go to
prison till he paid a fine to the king; so for the same reason, if an
husbandman is bound that he shall not sow his land, the bond is against
the common law.... And if he who undertakes upon him to work is
unskilful, his ignorance is a sufficient punishment to him ... and if
any one takes him to work and spoils it, an action on the case lies
against him. And the Statute of 5 Eliz. 4, which prohibits every person
from using or exercising any craft, mystery, or occupation unless he has
been an apprentice by the space of 7 years was not enacted only to the
intent that workmen should be skilful, but also that youth should not be
nourished in idleness, but brought up and educated in lawful sciences
and trades: and therefore it appears that without an Act of Parliament
none can be prohibited from working in any lawful trade. Also the common
law doth not prohibit any person from using several Arts or mysteries at
his pleasure....</p>

<p>2. That the said Restraint of the defendant for more than the said Act
of 5 Eliz. has made was against law, and therefore for as much as the
Statute has not restrained him who has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span> served as an apprentice for
seven years from exercising the trade of a tailor, the said ordinance
can't prohibit him from exercising his trade till he has presented
himself before them, or till they allow him to be a workman; for these
are against the liberty and freedom of the subject, and are a means of
extortion in drawing money from them, either by delay or some other
subtil device or by oppression of young Tradesmen by the old and rich of
the same Trade, not permitting them to work in their trade freely; and
all this is against the Common Law and the commonwealth. But ordinances
for the good order and government of men of Trades and Mysteries are
good, but not to restrain any one in his lawful mystery.</p>

<p>3. It was resolved that the said branch of the Act of 5 Eliz. is
intended of a public use and exercise of a trade to all who will come,
and not of him who is a private cook, tailor, brewer, baker, etc., in
the house of any for the use of a family, and therefore the said
ordinance had been good and consonant to law. Such a private exercise
and use had not been within it, for every one may work in such a private
manner, although he has never been an apprentice in the trade.</p>

<p>4. It was resolved that the Statute of 19 H. 7, cap. 7, doth not
corroborate any of the ordinances made by any corporation, which are so
allowed and approved as the Statute speaks, but leaves them to be
affirmed as good, or disaffirmed as unlawful, by the law; the sole
benefit which the corporation obtains by such allowance is that they
shall not incur the penalty of 40<i>l.</i> mentioned in the Act, if they put
in use any ordinances which are against the king's prerogative, or the
common profit of the people.</p>

<p>Judgment for defendant.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_272_272" id="Footnote_272_272"></a><a href="#FNanchor_272_272"><span class="label">[272]</span></a> This case is important as an illustration of the attitude

[<i>Gildhall Library. The case of the Commonalty of the Corporation of
Weavers of London truly stated</i>],<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> <i>c.</i> 1649.</p>

<p>Humbly presented to the consideration of the honourable House of
Commons.</p>

<p>All legal jurisdictions over a number of people or society of men must
either be primitive or derivative. Now primitive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span> jurisdiction is
undoubtedly in the whole body, and not in one or more members, all men
being by nature equal to other; and all jurisdictive power over them,
being founded by a compact and agreement with them, is invested in one
or more persons, who represent the whole, and by the consent of the
whole are empowered to govern by such rules of equality towards all, so
that both governor and governed may know certainly what the one may
command and what the other must obey; without the performance of which
mutual contract all obligations are cancelled, and that jurisdictive
power returns unto its first spring (the people) from whence it was
conveyed.</p>

<p>And doubtless whatever power our Governors of the Corporation of Weavers
may pretend and plead for, if they had any rationally, they had it at
first from the whole body, as it stands incorporated into a civil
society of men walking by such rules, established for the preservation
of the trade, advancement and encouragement of the profession thereof.</p>

<p>And if it be objected that they had a charter granted them by the King,
wherein they are invested that power they challenge, we answer that
there is not any one liberty that is granted to them but that is also
granted to the meanest member of the said company. The words of the
charter are these:&mdash;</p>

<p>[Here follows a copy of the charter granted by King Henry II to the
Weavers of London.]</p>

<p>So that it is clear that this grant was not to so many particular men,
but to the whole society; and what power soever any person or persons
were afterwards invested withall must of necessity be by the consent,
election, and approbation of the whole body; and if our Egyptian
taskmasters have any further commission for their usurped power over us,
why do they not produce it? Certainly, if they could, they would. But
having none they plead custom and precedents, both which they will find
but broken reeds to lean upon, but rotten props to support their
worm-eaten sovereignty.</p>

<p>1. For first, there must be these two things to make a custom valid: (i)
Usage; (ii) Time. Yet that time must be such whereof there is no memory
of man, and the usage must be peaceable, without interruption. But both
these are wanting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> to strengthen their claim to their pretended power
over us.</p>

<p>2. Suppose there were a custom, and that it had been time out of mind
also, yet if long usurpations of power could make the exercise thereof
legal, the very foundation of just government were subverted.</p>

<p>3. No custom against an Act of Parliament is valid in law. But the
custom claimed by our governors is against the very fundamental
constitutions both of all civil societies and of several Acts of
Parliament, which ordain that all elections shall be free, chiefly 3 of
Ed. I, chap. 5, by virtue of which the people choose all their officers
and magistrates in the several parishes and precincts in this kingdom.
And if it be according to law in the major, the commonwealth, it must
consequently hold in the minor, a particular corporation or civil
society of men, as we are, etc.</p>

<p>4. But customs are only valid when reasonable.... Now nothing in the
world can be more unreasonable than that such a number of men as 16
should have liberty to exercise a power over as many thousands, without,
nay against, their wills, consent, or election ..., the challenge and
exercise of such a power over a people being the perfectest badge of
slavery that men can be subjected to.</p>

<p>But we shall proceed in a discovery of those oppressions and abuses
which we complain so much against in our governors.</p>

<p>1st Charge. They have admitted aliens to be members for sums of money,
contrary to the statutes of the realm, orders of the Lord Mayor and
Court of Aldermen, customs of the city, and ordinances of the
company.... They have brought in by their own confession three hundred
and twelve strangers to be masters of the said company, and have taken
for their admittance 5<i>l.</i> a man, which amounted to 1,560<i>l.</i>, or
thereabouts.... They object that the strangers admitted are broad
weavers and deal not in the commodities that we trade in, viz., ribbon,
lace, etc.</p>

<p>The objection is false; for most of us can, and many of us have wrought,
as good broad stuffs as are nowadays made, and would do still, were it
not for the vast number of strangers (which have engrossed the
trade).... And if it be demanded how or by what means they got the trade
into their hands,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> we answer that at the beginning of the war many of us
and our servants engaged for the Parliament, and, in our absence, they,
being generally malignant, staying at home, and keeping servants all of
their own country, never employing any English, as they by law ought, by
degrees got all the trading, so that now the war is ended, and we
returned to follow our callings, we can get no employment. By which
means many hundreds have been forced to leave the trade, as to be
porters, labourers, water-bearers, etc., and many forced to take relief
from the several parishes wherein they dwell....</p>

<p>2nd Charge. They have admitted natives to weave and set up weaving in
their gild, without serving seven years, contrary to the statutes,
orders and customs aforesaid, as hath been proved by several witnesses
before the Committee of the honourable House.</p>

<p>3rd Charge. They exact extraordinary fees of those persons that they
make free or admit, taking a silver spoon of an ounce and a half weight,
and five shillings and eightpence in money, contrary to the Statute of
22 of Hen. VIII, chap. 4, and 28 of Hen. VIII, chap. 5....</p>

<p>4th Charge. They have deprived the commonalty of their rights in their
first ordinance, which saith the bailiffs are to be chosen by the
bailiffs, wardens, assistants, and commonalty, which ordinance is
grounded upon the Statute of 3rd of Ed. I, chap. 5, which saith
elections ought to be free, etc.</p>

<p>As touching the right of election, sufficient hath been spoken in the
preamble before these charges; only give us leave to insert a few
particulars in answer to their objection.</p>

<p>1. Whereas they object, that the commonalty are represented in the
livery of the said company, we answer:&mdash;Legal representatives must be
legally chosen by the persons represented, or else they cannot, or at
least ought not, to be bound by their determinations. But the livery-men
of our company are chosen by the bailiffs and governors, and not by the
commonalty, so may properly be called the governors' representatives and
not ours, we being never called upon to give our voice in their
elections. Neither are they, indeed, elected, but brought in for 5<i>l.</i> a
man. In lieu whereof they are invested with a peculiar privilege above
others, by being empowered to keep more servants than ordinary, by which
means the commonalty is destroyed also....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>5th Charge. They have dismissed the yeomanry contrary to six several
orders made with their consent by the Lord Mayor and Court of
Assistants.</p>

<p>But they object that they have not dismissed them, etc. If they had not
dismissed them, what needed so many several orders to be made to the
contrary? But we desire you to take notice that the yeomanry did consist
of sixteen persons which were authorized by the aforesaid six several
orders to search and find out the abuses in trade, viz., intruders that
had not served seven years, and that none but serviceable goods might be
made for the commonwealth. Now, because these governors gain by
intruders, making them pay for their permission, and driving the
greatest trade, making much light and deceitful work, therefore they
have dismissed the said yeomanry, by reason whereof both the said evils
are continued. Besides, the yeomanry by the said orders were to have the
journeymen's quarteridges for their pains, but now being by them
dismissed they gather the quarteridges and share it among themselves.</p>

<p>6th Charge. That they have wasted the treasure and stock of the company
in byways, and have not made that provision for the poor members of the
company as by their trust they ought to have done.</p>

<p>So that what with their feastings, defending vexatious suits contrary to
law, purchasing a monopoly, large fees for councillors, bills,
demurrers, suits against weavers of other companies, etc., they have in
one year out of the company's stock and income (which amounted but to
791<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>) spent 566<i>l.</i> 19<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, which year's account
agrees with their disbursements other years also; and for 200<i>l.</i> given
by one Mr. Ralph Hamon to purchase land for the poor, they have
purchased none to this day, but have shared the money among
themselves....</p>

<p>The premises considered, and all other circumstances duly weighed, our
desires for the freedom of elections being both legal and rational, our
sufferings and abuses under usurping pretended governors so abusive and
offensive, our wants so great, company so numerous, trading so little,
and that too devoured by strangers, ... we therefore hope that all these
things put together will be of such weight with all conscientious, godly
men in this honourable House of Commons, as that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> we shall not need to
fear your willing assistance for the redressing of these great evils and
granting our just desires. The speedy performance whereof will not only
gain unto you the prayers of many thousand persons who are ready to
perish for want of trading, but also engage them, as heretofore, so for
the future, to stand by you in your greatest necessities, for the
strengthening your hands in the execution of justice and judgment, and
redress of the oppressions of the nation.</p>

<p>The documents in this section illustrate the regulation of industrial
relationships by the government of the Tudors and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span> of the first two
Stuarts. The principal aims of their policy were to check the movement
of the textile industries from the town to country districts (Nos. 3 and
6), to prevent the concentration of industry in the hands of capitalists
(Nos. 3 and 11), or the creation of a necessitous proletariat (No. 4),
to exercise a police supervision over the movement of labour (Nos. 6, 7
and 14), to maintain the quality of English goods (No. 2), to prevent
class encroaching on class (Nos. 5 and 6) either through the wage earner
demanding excessive wages (No. 5) or through the employer beating them
down unduly (Nos. 8, 10, 19, 20), in short to crystallize existing
relationships with such changes only as the economic developments of
recent years, particularly the fall in the value of money (No. 6), and
the spread of the textile industries into rural districts (No. 3) made
inevitable.</p>

<p>The system was developed in numerous Acts, of which the most important
are given below (Nos. 3, 6 and 10). The most comprehensive measure was
the Statute of Artificers of 1563 (No. 6). There was little original in
this Act. Just as the Statutes forbidding depopulation (Part II, section
I) really only developed manorial customaries into a national system,
and the Poor Law Statutes (Part II, section IV) were based on the
experiments of municipal authorities, so the Statute of Artificers was
based partly on the practices of gilds (Part II, section II), partly on
the medi&aelig;val Statutes of Labourers (see Part I, section VI, Nos.
12&mdash;19). Indeed, Cecil's original proposal (No. 5) seems to have been to
re-enact 12 Richard II, cap. 3, which the rise in prices had made out of
date. If seriously entertained, this idea must have been discarded. The
most important innovation introduced by the statute in its final form
was the substitution of a system of industrial regulation applying to
almost the whole country for regulations applying to particular
localities and particular trades.</p>

<p>The most important parts of the Statute of Artificers were those
relating to apprenticeship and to the assessment of wages. The former,
if we may judge by the proceedings of the County Justices (Nos. 11 &amp; 15)
and of municipal authorities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> (Part II, section II, Nos. 9, 10, 11, 15),
seem to have been administered with considerable strictness, which was
only to be expected in view of the interest which gilds, boroughs,
traders and craftsmen generally had in seeing that they were carried
out. Judicial interpretations seem, however, to have begun at an early
date to whittle them away to some extent (No. 17), for the Judges
disliked rules "in restraint of trade" (No. 24 and section II, No. 18).</p>

<p>The wage clauses of the Statute present a more difficult problem. There
is no doubt that their object was to fix a maximum (not a minimum) wage
for agricultural labour (Nos. 6 and 14), which, however, should move
with movements in prices. This policy was not so oppressive as it
appears to us, because of the wide distribution of landed property, the
consequent fact that comparatively few rural workers depended entirely
upon wages for their living, and the relatively small difference between
the social position of the small farmer or master craftsman and the
hired persons whom they employed. In a colony like Massachusetts, where
the policy of fixing maximum wages was adopted, its motive was seen in
the simplest form (No. 21). Even in England, however, the same motives
were at work to a less degree (Nos. 5, 22 and 23). The policy of fixing
a maximum wage was, in fact, on a par with that of fixing prices, and
probably popular with the small masters and small landholders, who
formed a large proportion of the urban and rural population. It did not
come to an end with the destruction of the absolute monarchy, but
continued, with fair regularity, down to 1688, and, after that, with
much less regularity, at any rate to 1762.</p>

<p>The regulation of wages did not, however, only aim at fixing a maximum.
It also aimed on some, perhaps rare, occasions at fixing a minimum, at
any rate for workers in the textile industries. These latter were
treated in a special way, because the development of capitalism in the
textile industries (Nos. 2, 3, 8, 16 and 19) had created a wage problem
of a modern kind, at any rate in the south and east of England, such as
did not yet exist in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> agriculture. Municipal authorities had in the past
fixed minimum rates for textile workers (section II, No. 5). In 1593
four Bills were drafted which proposed to do the same by legislation, of
which one is printed below (No. 8), and in 1603-04 an Act (No. 10) was
passed to this effect. Two examples of the establishment of minimum
rates are given from the proceedings of the Wiltshire Quarter Sessions,
in 1602 and 1623. In the former case (No. 9) a piece list was drafted by
a committee of clothiers and weavers, which was subsequently issued
without alteration by the Justices (No. 13). In the latter case (No. 18)
the textile workers of Wiltshire asked the Justices to enforce the
assessment of wages on their employers, and the Justices complied by
ordering the rates to be published at Devizes. This shows that the
regulation of wages did in some cases protect the workers. Naturally,
however, the Justices required stimulating in this part of their duties,
and during the period of Charles I's personal government the Privy
Council intervened to compel them to fix rates, as it did to compel them
to administer the Poor Laws. In 1630 it received a petition from the
textile workers of Suffolk and Essex complaining that their wages had
been reduced, and appointed commissioners to investigate the matter (No.
19), who compelled the employers to raise wages (No. 20). The policy of
fixing <i>minimum</i> rates seems to have come to an end with the fall of the
absolute monarchy in 1640, though it was occasionally revived by
Parliament in the sixteenth century. (Part III, section III, Nos. 3, 4
and 15).</p>

<p>Before my right hearty commendations to your good lordship. It may
please the same to understand, that divers of the clothmakers in these
parts have been with me, declaring unto me, that in case they shall be
compelled to make cloth from Michaelmas forwards according to the king's
act, it shall cause them and other of their occupation to cease and
forbear clothmaking, saying, that it is impossible to keep the breadth
of the cloth limited by the act, and also that the weavers, being very
poor men, have not nor be able to provide looms and sleys to weave
clothes according to the act. Whereunto I answered them, that there is
much slander in outward parts for false clothmaking, and for remedy
thereof this act was provided; and or ever the act was made, there were
divers clothmakers spoken with, who affirmed, that it was reasonable;
wherefore I told them that I thought that they did rather seek occasion
to continue still false clothmaking, than put their good endeavour to
make true cloth according to the act; and also I shewed to them, that the
King's Highness had suspended the same act by a long time by his
proclamation, to the intent that they might provide looms and other
necessaries for the making of true cloth according to the act, wherefore
I marvelled much that they had been so negligent in the provision
thereof, declaring unto them, that I thought that the King's Highness
would not defer the execution of the act any longer; which it seemed to
me they lamented very sorely, saying that they would leave their
occupying for the time; for they could not by no possible means make
cloth according to the act, and specially for their breadth; and I bade
them take heed and beware, for I thought, they might perform the act, if
they had good will and good zeal to the common weal; and if they by
obstinacy or wilfulness would leave clothmaking, whereby percase might
grow murmur and sedition among the people for lack of work, that then it
would be laid to their charges, to their perils and utter undoings.
Whereunto they said obediently, that they would do that lay in their
possible powers, but more they could not, beseeching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span> me, that I would
be a means to the King's Highness once again to suspend the act, which I
would not promise them to do, and so left them for this time in despair
of this matter; and so now advertise your good lordship thereof, to the
intent that, if it seem by your wisdom convenient, ye may move the
King's Majesty hereof to the intent, his Grace's pleasure may be known,
whether his Highness of his goodness would yet suspend the act for one
other year, which in my poor opinion, if so may stand with his Grace's
pleasure, shall not be much amiss, beseeching your good lordship, that I
may be advertised hereof as soon as you conveniently may; for Michaelmas
is the last day of the old proclamation for this matter; and thus fare
your good lordship as heartily well as I would myself. Written at
Terlyng the 23rd day of September.</p>

Statutes of the Realm, Vol. IV, Part I, p. 286-87</i>], 1555.</p>

<p>Forasmuch as the weavers of this realm have, as well at this present
parliament as at divers other times, complained that the rich and
wealthy clothiers do many ways oppress them, some by setting up and
keeping in their houses divers looms, and keeping and maintaining them
by journeymen and persons unskilful, to the decay of a great number of
artificers which were brought up in the said science of weaving, their
family and household, some by ingrossing of looms into their hands and
possession, and letting them out at such unreasonable rents as the poor
artificers are not able to maintain themselves, much less their wives,
family and children, some also by giving much less wages and hire for
the weaving and workmanship of [cloth] than in times past they did,
whereby they are enforced utterly to forsake their art and occupation
wherein they have been brought up: It is therefore, for remedy of the
premises, and for the avoiding of a great number of inconveniences which
may grow (if in time it be not foreseen)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span> ordained, established and
enacted, by authority of this present parliament, that no person using
the feat or mistery of clothmaking and dwelling out of a city, borough,
market town or corporate town, shall from the feast of St. Michael the
Archangel now next ensuing, keep, retain or have in his or their house
or possession any more or above one woollen loom at one time, nor shall
by any means directly or indirectly receive or take any manner profit,
gain or commodity by letting or setting any loom, or any house wherein
any loom is or shall be used and occupied, which shall be together by
him set or let, upon pain of forfeiture for every week that any person
shall do contrary to the tenour and true meaning hereof 20<i>s.</i></p>

<p>And be it further ordained and enacted by like authority, that no
woollen weaver using or exercising the feat or mistery of weaving, and
dwelling out of city, borough, market town or town corporate, shall
after the said feast have or keep at any time above the number of two
woollen looms, or receive any profit, gain or commodity, directly or
indirectly as is aforesaid, by any more than two looms at one time, upon
pain to forfeit for every week that any person shall offend or do to the
contrary 20<i>s.</i></p>

<p>And it is further ordained and enacted by like authority, that no person
which shall after the said feast, use, exercise or occupy only the feat
or mistery of a weaver, and not clothmaking, shall during the time that
he shall use the feat or mistery of a weaver, keep or have any tucking
mill, or shall use or exercise the feat or mistery of a [tucker] or
dyer, upon pain to forfeit for every week that he shall so do 20<i>s.</i></p>

<p>And it is further enacted by like authority, that no person which after
the said feast shall use, exercise or occupy the feat or mistery of a
tucker or fuller, shall during the time that he shall so use the said
feat or mistery, keep or have any loom in his house or possession, or
shall directly or indirectly take any profit or commodity by the same,
upon pain to forfeit for every week 20<i>s.</i></p>

<p>And it is further ordained and enacted by like authority, that no person
whatsoever, which heretofore hath not used or exercised the feat,
mistery or art of clothmaking, shall after the said feast, make or weave
or cause to be made or woven any kind of broad white woollen cloths, but
only in a city,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> borough, town corporate or market town, or else in such
place or places where such cloths have been used to be commonly made by
the space of ten years next before the making this act; upon pain of
forfeiture for every cloth otherwise made five pounds.</p>

<p>Provided always and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid,
that it shall not be lawful to any person or persons being a weaver, or
that doth or shall use the art or mistery of a weaver or weaving,
dwelling out of a city, borough, town corporate or market town, to have
in his and their service any more or above the number of two apprentices
at one time; upon pain to forfeit for every time that he shall offend or
do contrary to this branch or article the sum of ten pounds.</p>

<p>And further be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall not
be lawful to or for any person or persons to set up the art or mistery
of weaving, after the said feast of St. Michael, unless the same person
or persons so setting up the same art or mistery of weaving, have been
apprentice to the same art or mistery, or exercised the same, by the
space of 7 years at the least; upon pain of twenty pounds to be
forfeited to the King and Queen's Majesties, her Grace's heirs or
successors, the one moiety of all which forfeitures shall be to the King
and Queen's Highnesses, heirs [and] successors, and the other moiety to
him or them that will sue for the same in any court of record by action
of debt, bill, plaint or information, wherein no wager of law, essoigne
or protection shall be admitted or allowed for the defendant.</p>

<p>... Provided always, and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that
this act or anything therein contained shall [not] in any way extend or
be prejudicial to any person or persons that doth or shall dwell in the
counties of York, Cumberland, Northumberland or Westmoreland; but that
they and every of them shall and may have and keep looms in their
houses, and do and exercise all and every thing and things for or
concerning spinning, weaving, cloth working and clothmaking in the said
counties, as they or any of them might have done or exercised lawfully
before the making of this statute; anything contained in this statute to
the contrary in any way notwithstanding.</p>

<p>For as much as great poverty, penury, and lack of living hath of late
years followed, ... and one of the chiefest occasions thereof, as it is
thought, ... is by reason of the over hasty marriages and over soon
setting up of households of and by the youth and young folks of the said
city [of London], which hath commonly used, and yet do, to marry
themselves as soon as ever they come out of their apprenticehood, be
they ever so young and unskilful, yea, and often times many of them so
poor that they scantily have of their proper goods wherewith to buy
their marriage apparel ... and forasmuch as the chiefest occasion of the
said inconveniences, as it is very evident, is by reason that divers and
sundry apprentices, as well of the said artificers as also of other
citizens of the said city, are commonly bound for so few years that
their terms of apprenticeability expireth and endeth oversoon, and that
they are there upon incontinently made free of the said city; ... for
remedy, stay, and reformation whereof it is ordained ... that no manner

Considerations delivered to the Parliament, 1559.</p>

<p>1. <i>Vagabonds.</i>&mdash;That the statute I Edward VI, Chap, viii., concerning
idle persons and vagabonds being made slaves, now repealed, be revived
with additions.</p>

<p>2. <i>Labourers and Servants.</i>&mdash;That the Statutes 12 Richard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> II, Chap.
iii, "that no servant or labourer at the end of this term depart out of
the hundred or place where he dwells," etc., and 13 Richard II, Chap.
viii., ordering the Justices at every session to appoint by proclamation
the wages of workers, etc., be confirmed with the addition "that no man
hereafter receive into service any servant without a testimonial from
the master he last dwelt with, sealed with a Parish Seal kept by the
constable or churchwarden, witnessing he left with the free license of
his master, penalty &pound;10." So, by the hands of the masters, servants may
be reduced to obedience, which shall reduce obedience to the Prince and
to God also; by the looseness of the time no other remedy is left but by
awe of law to acquaint men with virtue again, whereby the Reformation of
religion may be brought in credit, with the amendment of manners, the
want whereof has been imputed as a thing grown by the liberty of the
Gospel, etc.</p>

<p>3. <i>Husbandry.</i>&mdash;That the Statutes, 4 Hen VII, Chap. 9, "for re-edifying
houses of husbandry, and to avoid the decay of towns and villages," and
5 Edward VI, Chap. 5, "for maintenance of husbandry and tillage," be put
in execution.</p>

<p>4. <i>Purchase of Lands.</i>&mdash;No husbandman, yeoman or artificer to purchase
above 5<i>l.</i> by the year of inheritance, save in cities, towns and
boroughs, for their better repair; one mansion house only to be
purchased over and above the said yearly value. The common purchasing
thereof is the ground of dearth of victuals, raising of rents, etc.</p>

<p>5. <i>Merchants.</i>&mdash;No merchant to purchase above &pound;50 a year of
inheritance, except aldermen and sheriffs of London, who, because they
approach to the degree of knighthood, may purchase to the value of &pound;200.</p>

<p>6. <i>Apprentices.</i>&mdash;None to be received apprentice except his father may
spend 40<i>s.</i> a year of freehold, nor to be apprenticed to a merchant
except his father spend &pound;10 a year of freehold, or be descended from a
gentleman a merchant. Through the idleness of these professions so many
embrace them that they are only a cloak for vagabonds and thieves, and
there is such a decay of husbandry that masters cannot get skilful
servants to till the ground without unreasonable wages, etc....</p>

Realm, Vol. IV, Part I, pp. 414-22</i>], 1563.</p>

<p>I. Although there remain in force presently a great number of statutes
concerning ... apprentices, servants and labourers, as well in husbandry
as in divers other ... occupations, yet partly for the imperfection and
contrariety ... in sundry of the said laws, and for the variety and
number of them, and chiefly for that the wages and allowances limited in
many of the said statutes are in divers places too small ... respecting
the advancement of prices ... the said laws cannot conveniently without
the greatest grief and burden of the poor labourer and hired man be put
in due execution; and as the said statutes were at the time of the
making of them thought to be very good and beneficial ..., as divers of
them yet are, so if the substance of as many of the said laws as are
meet to be continued shall be digested and reduced into one sole law,
and in the same an uniform order prescribed ..., there is good hope that
it will come to pass that the same law, being duly executed, should
banish idleness, advance husbandry and yield unto the hired person both
in the time of scarcity and in the time of plenty a convenient
proportion of wages: Be it therefore enacted.... That as much of the
statutes heretofore made as concern the hiring, keeping, departing,
working, wages or order of servants, workmen, artificers, apprentices
and labourers ... shall be from and after the last day of September next
ensuing repealed....</p>

age of thirty years that after the feast of Easter next shall marry, and

... nor in any other art, nor in household or in any office with any
nobleman, gentleman or others, ..., nor having a convenient farm or
other holding in tillage whereupon he may employ his labour, shall
(during the time that he shall so be unmarried or under the age of 30
years), upon request made by any person using the art or mystery wherein

grieved shall complain; which said justices or chief officer shall have
the hearing and ordering of the matter between the said master [etc.]
and servant, according to the equity of the cause; and no such master
[etc.] shall put away any such servant at the end of his term, or any
such servant depart from his said master [etc.] at the end of his term,
without one quarter warning given ... upon the pain hereafter ensuing.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap"><a name="Proposals_for_the_Better_Administration_of_the_Statute_of" id="Proposals_for_the_Better_Administration_of_the_Statute_of"></a>Proposals for the Better Administration of the Statute of
Artificers</span> [<i>S.P.D., Eliz., Vol. 88, No. 11</i>], 1572.</p>

<p>Whereas there passed an act in the Parliament holden at Westminster in
the fifth year of the reign of our most gracious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span> Sovereign Lady the
Queen's Majesty that now is, touching divers good and laudable orders
for artificers, labourers, servants of husbandry, and apprentices; in
the which act, amongst divers and sundry good branches therein
contained, there are two specially to be noted, which, as it should
seem, were then and therein specially enacted for the only means of the
better maintaining of the same act in the full strength and virtue,
according to the true meaning thereof: which have been, and yet daily
are, as well by the subtle devices of some lewd servants, as also by the
disorderly dealings of some masters, mistresses, and dames, not only
neglected, but also wilfully violated and broken, whereby the true, good
and godly meaning of the same act, for so good and laudable an order
provided in that behalf, doth and will daily grow to be accounted as
frustrate and of none effect: and as it now already is the chief, or
only, cause of the great number of idle vagabonds, wherewith the realm
at this present is so replenished: so, without it shall please the
Queen's Majesty by good advice to provide some speedy remedy therefore,
it will not only be a means of the increasing of them but also of their
maintenance.</p>

<p>The two branches to be noted are these:&mdash;</p>

<p>The points wherein the masters, mistresses, dames, and servants do so
abuse the two foresaid branches, that they be in a manner to frustrate.</p>

<p>It is too manifest, that divers and sundry servants, retained as well in
husbandry as in other the arts and sciences aforesaid, and others out of
those sciences throughout the whole Realm do daily, notwithstanding this
act, and without any fear of the penalty thereof, at their pleasures
before the time of their covenanted service be expired, either purloin
somewhat from their masters, mistresses, and dames, and so suddenly run
away, or else, not willing to be rebuked for their faults, do quarrel
with them, and so boldly depart away without any certificate<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> or
testimonial for their discharge: and being thus disorderly departed do
forge a testimonial, or get one to forge it for them, although they give
12<i>d.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> for the doing thereof, whereas, if they had orderly
departed, [it] should have cost them but 2<i>d.</i>: and with such
testimonial dare boldly pass from one shire to another, yea some time
from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span> one parish to another, and there be retained till they find the
like means, or pick the like occasion to depart in like disorder. And
the very cause why they dare thus boldly and disorderly depart, leaving
their masters, mistresses, and dames destitute in their most need, is
for that no order is kept, according to the Statute, in the making,
signing, and delivering of the testimonials: but [they] be made by the
masters themselves or by some other in their houses that can write, and
being so disorderly made, do, as disorderly, sign and deliver the same
without calling either parson, vicar, or other officer to the same:
which is a very good cause for a very simple servant, seeing how slight
a testimonial will serve him to pass with, to move him to forge the like
at all times after to serve his turn. And yet if they were orderly made,
signed, and delivered, according to Statute, it could no better serve
his turn to pass with than one of these: for if he pass a shire or two
off from the place where he last served, neither the marks nor names
thereunto signed be there known scarce to one among a thousand.</p>

<p>For the second branch.&mdash;It is likewise too manifest, that there be many
masters, mistresses and dames, knowing how much the order of these
certificates or testimonials be abused, which have not letted to retain
such servants so departed without showing any certificates or
testimonials at all, willing for necessity's sake to retain rather a
simple vagabond coming without his certificate, than a subtle vagabond
coming with his forged testimonials, as he doubteth, and yet perchance
is true indeed. But that is too hard for them to know, for that the
names therein are to them unknown, and the places, far asunder, not easy
to be tried: and so sometime an honest poor servant indeed passeth
unhired for want of good order keeping in these testimonials, and a very
vagabond indeed is some time hired in hope of his simplicity. And the
masters, mistresses, and dames be commonly deceived by both kinds when
they stand in most need of their service.</p>

<p>The cause why these good and laudable orders run to such decay by the
foresaid abuses, is, for that no one person hath any benefit, worth the
pains, and charges, to look to the redress hereof: the same being so
hard and painful a matter to be done throughout the realm, and
therewithall so chargeable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore if it may please the Queen's Majesty of her Highness' most
gracious benignity, for the better and speedier reformation hereof, to
appoint and give authority by her Majesty's Letters Patents for term of
years unto us, her Highness' most humble subjects, Richard Carmarden and
Edmond Mathew, our deputies and assigns, to give out one uniform order
of testimonials to every shire and parish throughout the realm at our
only costs and charges, taking therefore in recompense as well of our
said costs and charges, as also for our travails which we shall bestow
therein, no more than is already limited by the said Statute, which is
but two pence for every testimonial:<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> and that also these articles
here following may be annexed to the said Statute by this Parliament.</p>

<p>First, That there be no other certificates or testimonials used in the
realm, to be delivered to any servants by any person or persons, but
only such as shall be made and delivered by such as her Majesty hath or
shall appoint by her Highness' Letters Patents to do the same.</p>

<p>Secondly, That every servant so departing and having received one of the
same certificates or testimonials, and seeking again to serve, shall
first deliver, to such as shall be there appointed to be the officer's
deputies, his old testimonial cancelled, before he be again retained.</p>

<p>And thirdly, That none of the said certificates or testimonials, so
orderly delivered to any servant, shall be any discharge for him to pass
with for any longer time than for one month after the date thereof: and
if any person be taken with any testimonial, the date thereof being so
expired, then to be lawful for every head officer to take the said
testimonial from him, and to deliver the same cancelled to the officer's
deputy and to force him to serve or to be, etc.</p>

Weavers</span> [<i>S.P.D., Eliz., Vol. 244, No. 129</i>], 1593.</p>

<p>An Act as well to avoid deceits done by spinners of woollen yarn, and
weavers of woollen cloths, and to increase their wages, as also to
reform the great abuses and oppressions done to her Majesty's good
subjects by regrators of woollen yarn, commonly called yarn choppers or
jobbers of yarn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>Forasmuch as divers Laws and Statutes have been heretofore ordained for
the true making of woollen cloths, and divers penalties, in some cases
of money, and in some other cases of the cloths themselves, are by the
same Laws and Statutes imposed upon clothiers, by whom many thousands of
her Majesty's subjects are set to work, and maintained; and that it
falleth out many times, that divers faults punishable even with the loss
of their cloths without the clothiers' fault are voluntarily committed
by their spinners and weavers, by the one's deceitful spinning their
yarn, and by the other's false weaving the same into cloth; and
forasmuch as necessity doth partly enforce them thereunto, for lack of
sufficient wages and allowance for their workmanship at the hands of the
clothier, whereby to sustain the poor estate of themselves, their wives
and children; at the humble petition as well of the said clothiers, as
also of their said spinners and weavers, and first for the avoiding of
all deceitful dealing between the clothiers and their weavers, Be it
enacted by the Queen's most excellent Majesty, the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, and the Commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by
the authority of the same:&mdash;That all wool which, after the feast of
Easter next, shall be delivered for or by any clothier to any person or
persons to be spun, shall be delivered by true and lawful weight, and
that all and every spinner and spinners shall deliver again to or for
such clothier yarn of the same wool by the same true and lawful weight
(all necessary waste thereof excepted) without concealing any part
thereof, or deceitfully putting thereunto any oil, water, or other
thing, upon pain that every spinner doing the contrary shall forfeit
four times the value that such deceit by any such spinner committed or
done shall amount unto. And for the better relief of all and every the
said spinner and spinners, be it further enacted by the authority
aforesaid, that after the said feast all and every clothier and
clothiers and spinsters to the market shall pay for the spinning of
every pound weight of the best sorting warp three pence, of every pound
weight of the second warp two pence halfpenny, of every pound weight of
the worst warp to be used in sorting cloths two pence farthing, of every
pound weight of the best abbs<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> two pence halfpenny, of every pound
weight of the best sorting abbs two pence, and of every pound weight of
the worst sorting abbs to be used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span> in sorting cloths three halfpence
farthing, of every pound weight of single list three halfpence, upon
pain to forfeit for every penny that any such clothier shall withhold or
detain from any spinner contrary to the charitable intent of this
statute twelve pence.</p>

<p>To avoid all evil and corrupt dealing between clothiers and their
weavers, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid:&mdash;That all and every
weaver and weavers which after the said feast, shall have the weaving of
any woollen yarn to be webbed into cloth, shall weave, work, and put
into the web, for cloth to be made thereof, as much and all the same
yarn, as any clothier, or any other person for or in the behalf of any
clothier, shall deliver to the same weaver with his used mark put to the
same, without changing, or any parcel thereof leaving out of the same
web, or else shall restore to the same clothier the surplusage of the
same yarn, if any shall be left not put into the same web, without
deceitfully putting of any deceivable brine, moisture, sand, dust, or
other thing thereunto, upon pain to forfeit four times the value that
such deceit by any such weaver committed or done shall amount unto. And
for the better relief of all and every the said weaver and weavers be it
further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that after the said feast
all and every clothier and clothiers shall pay for the weaving of every
ell<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> containing three pounds weight in yarn, of every broad listed
cloth, as it shall be laid upon the bar and which shall be woven in a
fourteen hundred sley, sixteen pence, for the weaving of every ell,
containing three pounds weight and three-quarters in yarn of every broad
listed cloth, as it shall be laid upon the bar and which shall be woven
in a thirteen hundred sley, fourteen pence, and for every beer<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
between thirteen hundred and fourteen hundred twelve pence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span> for the
weaving of every ell containing three pounds weight and three-quarters
at the least in yarn of every broad listed cloth as it shall be laid
upon the bar and which shall be woven in a twelve hundred sley, ten
pence, and for every beer between twelve hundred and thirteen hundred
two shillings, for weaving of every ell containing three pounds weight
and an half at the least in yarn of every broad listed cloth as it shall
be laid upon the bar and which shall be woven in a eleven hundred sley,
eight pence, and for every beer between eleven hundred and twelve
hundred, twelve pence, for weaving of every ell containing three pounds
weight and an half at the least in yarn of every broad listed cloth as
it shall be laid upon the bar and which shall be woven in a ten hundred
sley, six pence, and for every beer between ten hundred and eleven
hundred twelve pence, for weaving of every broad listed cloth, that
shall be woven in a sley under a ten hundred, and that shall contain
thirty ells as it shall be laid upon the bar, twelve shillings, for the
weaving of every broad listed cloth that shall be woven in a sley under
a ten hundred, and that shall contain eight and twenty ells as it shall
be laid upon the bar, ten shillings, for weaving of every narrow listed
sorting cloth that shall be woven in a ten hundred sley, ten shillings,
for the weaving of every narrow listed sorting cloth that shall be woven
in a nine hundred sley, nine shillings, for the weaving of every narrow
listed sorting cloth that shall be woven in an eight hundred sley, eight
shillings, and for the weaving of every beer over and above in any of
the said sleys of the said narrow listed cloths three pence, upon pain
to forfeit for every penny that any clothier shall withhold or detain
from any weaver contrary to the true intent of this act twelve pence.</p>

<p>And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid that wheresoever
any greater wages hath been heretofore usually given for spinning any of
the sorts of yarn aforesaid or for weaving any of the sorts of cloths
aforesaid, that there and in all such place the same wages or greater
shall after the said feast be given without any diminution thereof, upon
pain that every clothier shall forfeit for every penny that he or she
shall so detain from any spinner or weaver contrary to the true intent
of this act twelve pence, any the rate or wages before in this act
particularly limited and appointed to weavers notwithstanding. And be it
further enacted by the said authority, that after the said feast no
clothier, for the weaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span> of any his or her white cloths, shall use or
cause to be used any sley of less breadth than eleven quarters and three
nails of the yard in white work beside the list, upon pain to forfeit
for every such default ten shillings. And be it further enacted by the
authority aforesaid that after the said feast no clothier shall use any
warping bar that shall contain any greater length than three yards from
one pin to another upon pain to forfeit for every such default ten
shillings. And further be it enacted by the authority aforesaid that
justices of assize in their circuits, justices of peace in their
sessions, sheriffs in their turns, stewards in their leets and lawdays,
mayors, sheriffs, and bailiffs of cities, boroughs and towns corporate
in their courts, shall and may inquire, hear, and determine from time to
time all and every the said offences committed and done within the
limits of their several jurisdictions and authorities.</p>

<p>[Here follow provisions as to the division of fines.]</p>

<p>And forasmuch as divers evil-disposed persons commonly called yarn
choppers or jobbers of woollen yarn, wanting the fear of God, and caring
only for their own private gain without having any regard to the
maintenance of the commonwealth, using no trade either of making woollen
cloths, or of any other thing made of woollen yarn, inverting the true
intent of the statute made in the eighth year of our late Sovereign Lord
King Henry the sixth among other things especially to destroy the
falsity of regrators of yarn called yarn choppers, to their own
malicious purpose, do in every fair and market buy up and get into their
hands so great quantities of woollen yarn, that the clothiers and others
using lawful trade wherein woollen yarn must need be occupied, and by
which trade many thousands of her Majesty's poor subjects are relieved,
are driven for their necessity sake to buy the same at their hands
deceitfully handled and at such unreasonable price as they list to set
upon the same, whereby the clothiers and others using divers lawful ways
and means for the employment of woollen yarn, are very greatly hindered,
and such drones, idle members and evil weeds in a commonwealth by such
oppressions maintained and greatly enriched, for remedy whereof be it
enacted established and ordained by the authority aforesaid:&mdash;That no
manner of person or persons shall after the said feast of Easter next
buy, bargain, take, or make any promise for bargain or sale of or for
any woollen yarn but only such person or persons as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span> are known to be
makers of woollen cloth or other thing made of woollen yarn or mixed
with woollen yarn, his or their wife or wives or his or their children,
apprentices or servants, inhabiting in his or their mansion house or
houses, and who shall or may lawfully make of the said woollen yarn any
kind of bayes, knit hose, arras, tapestry, coverlets, or any other thing
or things used to be made of woollen yarn or mixed with woollen yarn,
upon pain of forfeiture of all woollen yarn to be bought, or whereof any
promise for bargain or sale thereof shall be taken or made contrary to
the true meaning of this act, in whose hands soever any such woollen
yarn shall be found, and further to incur all the pains and penalties
limited to yarn choppers by the said act made in the eighth year of King
Henry the sixth.</p>

[<i>1 James I, c. 6. Statutes of the Realm, Vol. IV, Part II, pp.
1022-24</i>], 1603-04.</p>

<p>... And whereas the said act [<i>i.e.</i> 5 Eliz., c. iv] hath not, according
to the true meaning thereof, been duly put in execution, whereby the
rates of wages for poor artificers, labourers and other persons whose
wages were meant to be rated by the said act, have not been rated and
proportioned according to the plenty, scarcity, necessity, and respect
of the time, which was politicly intended by the said act, by reason
that ambiguity and question have risen and been made whether the rating
of all manner artificers, workmen and workwomen, his and their wages,
other than such as by some statute and law have been rated, or else such
as did work about husbandry, should or might be rated by the said law;
Forasmuch as the said law hath been found beneficial for the
commonwealth, be it enacted by authority of this present parliament,
that the said statute, and the authority by the same statute given to
any person or persons for assessing and rating of wages, and the
authority to them in the said act committed, shall be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span> expounded and
construed, and shall by force of this act give authority to all persons
having any such authority to rate wages of any labourers, weavers,
spinsters, and workmen or workwomen whatsoever, either working by the
day, week, month, year, or taking any work at any person or persons'
hands whatsoever, to be done in great or otherwise....</p>

<p>And furthermore be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that if any
clothier or other shall refuse to obey the said order, rate or
assessment of wages as aforesaid, and shall not pay so much or so great
wages to their weavers, spinsters, workmen or workwomen as shall be so
set down rated and appointed, according to the true meaning of this act,
that then every clothier and other person and persons so offending shall
forfeit and lose for every such offence, to the party aggrieved, ten
shillings: and that if the said offence and offences of not paying so
much or so great wages to their said workmen, workwomen and others shall
be confessed by the offender, or that the same shall be proved by two
sufficient and lawful witnesses before the justices of peace in their
quarter sessions of the peace, the justices of assize in their sessions,
or before any two justices of the peace, whereof one to be of the
quorum; that then every such person shall forthwith stand and be in law
convicted thereof; which said forfeiture of ten shillings shall be
levied by distress and sale of the offenders goods, by warrant from the
said justices before whom any such conviction shall be had; which sale
shall be good in law against any such offender or offenders....</p>

<p>Provided nevertheless and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That
no clothier, being a justice of peace in any precinct or liberty, shall
be any rater of any wages for any weaver, tucker, spinster, or other
artizan that dependeth upon the making of cloth; and in case there be
not above the number of two justices of peace within such precinct or
liberty but such as are clothiers, that in such case the same wages
shall be rated and assessed by the major part of the common council of
such precinct or liberty, and such justice or justices of peace (if any
there be) as are not clothiers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

these offences. 17. <i>Item</i>, that any of those that shall disobey any of
these good orders that are set down, that there may be such penalties
inflicted upon any such persons as may be able to suffice them, and
shall be agreeable with the laws of the realm, and by such persons as
are thereunto authorised by the statutes and laws.</p>

James I, Vol.</i> LXXX, 13], 1615.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>

<p>The breeders of wool in all countries are of three sorts&mdash;</p>

<p>1. First those that are men of great estate, having both grounds and
stock of their own, and are beforehand in wealth. These can afford to
delay the selling of their wools and to stay the clothiers' leisure for
the payment to increase the price. The number of these is small.</p>

<p>2. Those that do rent the king's, noblemen's and gents' grounds and deal
as largely as either their stock or credit will afford. These are many
and breed great store of wool; most of them do usually either sell their
wools beforehand, or promise the refusal of them for money which they
borrowed at the spring of the year to buy them sheep to breed the wool,
they then having need of money to pay their Lady-day rent and to double
their stock upon the ground as the spring time requireth, and at that
time the clothiers disburse their stock in yams to lay up in stock
against hay-time and harvest when their spinning fails. So that then
farmers and clothiers have greatest want of money at one time.</p>

<p>3. The general number of husbandmen in all the wool countries that have
small livings, whereof every one usually hath some wool, though not
much. They are many in numbers in all countries and have great store of
wool, though in small parcels. Many of these also do borrow money of the
wool merchant to buy sheep to stock their commons. Their parcels being
so small, the times of selling so divers, the distance of place so great
between the clothier and them, it would be their undoing to stay the
clothier's leisure for the time of their sale, or to be subject to him
for the price....</p>

<p>These wools are usually converted by four sorts of people.</p>

<p>1. The rich clothier that buyeth his wool of the grower in the wool
countries, and makes his whole year's provision beforehand and lays it
up in store, and in the winter time hath it spun by his own spinsters
and woven by his own weavers and fulled by his own tuckers, and all at
the lowest rate for wages. These clothiers could well spare the wool
buyers that they might likewise have wool at their own prices, and the
rather because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span> many of them be brogging clothiers and sell again very
much, if not most, of the wool they buy.</p>

<p>2. The second is the meaner clothier that seldom or never travels into
the wool country to buy his wool, but borrows the most part of it at the
market, and sets many poor on work, clothes it presently, and sells his
cloth in some countries upon the bare thread, as in Devonshire and
Yorkshire, and others dress it and sell it in London for ready money,
and then comes to the wool market and pays the old debt and borrows
more. Of this sort there are great store, that live well and grow rich
and set thousands on work; they cannot miss the wool chapman, for if
they do they must presently put off all their workfolk, and become
servants to the rich clothier for 4<i>d.</i> or 6<i>d.</i> a day, which is a poor
living.</p>

<p>3. The third sort are such clothiers that have not stock enough to
bestow, some in wool and some in yarn, and to forbear some in cloth as
the rich clothiers do, and they buy but little or no wool, but do weekly
buy their yarn in the markets, and presently make it into cloth and sell
it for ready money, and so buy yarn again; which yarn is weekly brought
into the markets by a great number of poor people that will not spin to
the clothier for small wages; but have stock enough to set themselves on
work, and do weekly buy their wool in the market by very small parcels
according to their use and weekly return it in yarn, and make good
profit thereof, having their benefit both of their labour and of the
merchandise, and live exceeding well. These yarn-makers are so many in
number that it is supposed by men of judgment that more than half the
cloths that are made in Wilts, Gloucester, and Somersetshire is made by
the means of these yarn-makers and poor clothiers that depend weekly

money or credit.</p>

poor people inhabiting near the ports and coasts from Yarmouth to
Plymouth and in many great cities and towns, as London, Norwich,
Colchester, Canterbury, Southampton, Exeter and many others. These
people by their great industry and skill do spend a great part of the
coarse wools growing in the kingdom, and that at as high a price or
higher than the clothiers do the finest wools of this country, as
appeareth by a particular hereunto annexed....</p>

<p><i>Hil.</i> 12, <i>Iac.</i> 1 [Tolley's case]. It was agreed and resolved that an
upholsterer is not a trade within that Stat. For first it is not a trade
that is mentioned in any of the branches of the Statute, howsoever in
all parts of the Statute there is mention made of 61 several trades and
misteries. And if the artizans which at that time were assistants unto
the committees for the expressing of all manner of trades had thought
that the trade of an upholsterer had been such a trade that required art
and skill for the encouraging of it, they would not have failed to make
mention of it.... Thirdly the trade of an upholsterer doth not require
any art or skill for the exercizing of it, inasmuch as he hath all
things made to his hand, and it is only to dispose them in order after
such time as they are brought to him ... and so he is like Aesop's bird
which borroweth of every bird a feather, his art resting merely in the
overseeing and disposition of such things which other men work, and in
the putting of feathers into tick, and sewing them up when he hath done,
the which one that hath been an apprentice unto it but seven days is
able to perform. And the intent of this Statute was not to extend unto
any other trade but such as required art and skill for the managing of
them; and therefore it was adjudged in the Exchequer upon an information
against one [space] in the 42nd year of the late Queen Eliz. that a
costermonger was not a trade intended by the Statute of 5 Eliz., because
his art was in the selling of apples, which required no skill or
experience for the exercise of it. So an husbandman, tankardbearer,
brickmaker, porter, miller, and such like trades are not within the
Statute of 5 Eliz., cap 4, so as none may exercize them but such a one
as hath been an apprentice by the space of 7 years; for they are arts
which require ability of body rather than skill.</p>

the weavers, spinners, and others that work on the making of woollen
clothes, that are not able by their diligent labours to get their

extreme hard, and abated wages what they please. And some of them make
such their workfolks to do their household businesses, to trudge in
their errands, spool their chains, twist their list, do every command,
without giving them bread, drink, or money for many days' labour. May it
please you therefore, for the redressing of these enormities done by the
clothiers, to appoint certain grave and discreet persons to view the
straitness of works, to assess rates for wages according to the desert
of their works, now especially in this great dearth of corn, that the
poor artificers of these works of woollen cloth may not perish for want
of food, while they are painful in their callings, so shall many

<p>Whereas a petition was this day presented to the Board<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span> by Sylvia
Harbert, widow, on the behalf of herself and divers others, showing that
the poor spinsters, weavers and combers of wool in Sudbury and the
places near adjoining thereunto, in the counties of Suffolk and Essex,
are of late by the clothiers there (who are now grown rich by the
labours of the said poor people) so much abridged of their former and
usual wages, that they (who in times past maintained their families in
good sort) are now in such distress by the abatement of their wages in
these times of scarcity and dearth, that they are constrained to sell
their beds, wheels and working tools for want of bread, as by the
petition itself doth more at large appear, wherein the petitioners
humbly sought to be relieved by some directions from this Board:&mdash;their
Lordships upon consideration had thereof, have thought fit and ordered
that the petition being first signed by the Clerk of the Council
attendant shall be recommended to Sir Robert Crane, Bart., Sir Thomas
Wiseman, Sir William Maxey, Sir Drewe Deane, Kt., Thomas Eden, Doctor of
the Civil Law, Henry Gent, Esq., and Robert Warren, Justices of the
Peace of the counties aforesaid, Richard Skinner and Benjamin Fisher,
Aldermen of Sudbury, or to any four of them, whereof one Justice of the
Peace of each county, and one of the said aldermen, to be three, who are
hereby authorised and required to call before them such persons on
either side, as they think fittest to inform them of the true state of
these complaints, and thereupon to settle such a course for the relief
of the petitioners by causing just and orderly payment to be made them
of their due and accustomed wages, as that they may have no further
cause to complain, nor the Board be further troubled herewithall. And in
case any particular person shall be found (either out of the hardness of
his heart towards the poor, or out of private ends or humours)
refractory to such courses as the said commissioners shall think
reasonable and just, that then they bind over every such person to
answer the same before the Board.</p>

<p class='center'>Right Honourable and our very good Lord,</p>

<p>We have according to your lordship's order from the Council Board, dated
the 16th day of February, 1630, under the hand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span> of the Clerk of the
Council, called before us the saymakers, spinsters, weavers and combers,
of Sudbury and the towns adjoining, and have examined the cause of the
saymakers abating the wages of the spinsters, weavers and combers; and
asking the saymakers why they did so abate, their answer was that all of
that trade in other parts of the Kingdom did the like; but if it might
be reformed in all other parts, they were content to give such wages as
we should set down. Whereupon we did order, with the good liking of all
parties, as in this enclosed paper is set down. We therefore humbly pray
your lordships that the like order may be taken throughout all the
kingdom with men of that trade, by way of His Majesty's proclamation, or
any other order which may seem best to your lordships' wisdoms; for if
the like order be not more general than to Sudbury and the towns
adjacent, it must necessarily be their ruin and utter undoing. And so
commending the same to your lordships' further direction, we humbly
rest, your lordships' in all services to be commanded.</p>

from the Justices of the Peace in the county of Essex concerning the
Saymakers, Spinsters, Weavers and Combers of Sudbury.</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i> An order made at our meeting at Halsted in the said county the
eighth day of April Anno domini 1631 by virtue of an order from the
Lords of the Council.</p>

<p>It is ordered and agreed upon by us whose names are hereunder written,
that the saymakers within the town of Sudbury in Suffolk shall pay unto
the spinsters for spinning of every seven knots, one penny, and to have
no deduction of their wages, and that the reel whereon the yarn is
reeled to be a yard in length, and no longer, and we do further order,
that for all the white sayes under five pounds weight the saymaker shall
give unto the weaver twelve pence the pound for the weaving thereof, and
for the sayes that shall be above five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span> pounds and under ten pounds to
give twelve pence the pound, abating six pence in the piece for the
weaving thereof, and for the mingled sayes containing eight or nine
pounds, nine shillings, and so proportionably as it shall contain more
or less in weight. This our order to continue until the 15th day of May
next ensuing, except from the Council there shall be other order taken.</p>

p. 220</i>], 1645.</p>

<p>The war in England kept servants from coming to us, so as those we had
could not be hired, when their times were out, but upon unreasonable
terms, and we found it very difficult to pay their wages to their
content (for money was very scarce). I may upon this occasion report a
passage between one Rowley and his servant. The master, being forced to
sell a pair of his oxen to pay a servant his wages, told his servant he
could keep him no longer, not knowing how to pay him the next year. The
servant answered he would serve him for more of his cattle. 'But how
shall I do' (saith the master) 'when all my cattle are gone?' The
servant replied, 'You shall then serve me, and so you may have your
cattle again.'</p>

<p>At an adjourned sessions on 5 June an order was made that, whereas the
rate of wages fixed for servants and labourers had been proclaimed, but
young people, both men and maids, fitting for service, will not go
abroad to service without they may have excessive wages, but will rather
work at home at their own hands, whereby the rating of wages will take
little effect, therefore no young men or maids fitting to go abroad to
service (their parents not being of ability to keep them) shall remain
at home, but shall with all convenient speed betake themselves to
service for the wages aforesaid, which if they refuse to do the Justices
shall proceed against them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>Presentments by the Grand Jury. 1661, Ap. 23. We desire that the
overseers of parishes may not be hereafter compelled to provide houses
for such young persons as will marry before they have provided
themselves with a settling. We desire that servants' wages may be rated
according to the statute, for we find the unreasonableness of servants'
wages a great grievance so that the servants are grown so proud and idle
that the master cannot be known from the servant except it be because
the servant wears better clothes than his master.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> We desire that
the statute for setting poor men's children to apprenticeship be more
duly observed, for we find the usual course is that if any are
apprenticed it is to some petty trade, and when they have served their
apprenticeship they are not able to live by their trades, whereby not
being bred to labour they are not fit for husbandry. We therefore desire
that such children may be set to husbandry for the benefit of tillage
and the good of the commonwealth.</p>

<p>Upon reading this day at the board the humble Petition of Francis
Kiderbey of Framlingham ... draper, setting forth that he served his
apprenticeship for 7 years in the City of London to a Tailor, whereby he
came to the knowledge and skill of all sorts of cloth, and used and
exercised the same for a long time; that the petitioner's occasions
calling him to live in Framlingham aforesaid, and that town wanting one
that dealt in cloth, the petitioner set up a shop for selling the same,
and thereby got a good livelihood for himself and family; yet some, out
of malice, hath caused three bills of Indictment to be presented against
him at the sessions held at Woodbridge for that county upon the Statute
made 5 Eliz. c. 4, whereby it is provided that none shall use any manual
occupations but he that hath been bound seven years an apprentice to
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span> same, which Statute, though not repealed, yet has been by most of
the Judges looked upon as inconvenient to trade and to the increase of
inventions; that the Petitioner hath removed the said indictments into
the Court of King's Bench, where judgment will be given against him,
that statute being still in force, and therefore praying that his
Majesty will be pleased to give order to his Attorney-General to enter a
<i>non prosequi</i> for stopping proceedings against him. It was ordered by
his Majesty in Council that it be and it is hereby referred to Mr.
Attorney-General to examine the truth of the Petitioner's case, and upon
consideration thereof to report to his Majesty in Council his opinion
thereupon, and how far he conceives it may be fit for his Majesty to
gratify the Petitioner in his said request.</p>

<p>[On Dec. 17, 1669, the Attorney-General reported that Kiderbey was
liable to the penalty of the Statute, but that the indictments being in
the King's name, his Majesty might order a <i>non processe</i> to be entered;
which was ordered to be done.]</p>

<p>The national system of Poor Relief which was built up in the course of
the sixteenth century was composed of three elements, experiments of
municipal authorities, Parliamentary legislation, supervision and
stimulus supplied by the Privy Council. The first step taken by towns
was usually to organize begging by granting licences to certain
authorized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span> beggars, while punishing the idler (No. 1); the next to
provide establishments where necessitous persons could be set to work on
materials provided at the public expense (No. 3). The action of the
State followed the same lines of development. During the first three
quarters of the sixteenth century it (<i>a</i>) left the provision of the
funds needed for relief to private charity, (<i>b</i>) directed the relief of
the "impotent poor," but treated all able-bodied persons in one
category, that of "sturdy rogues." But in 1572 it recognized the
inadequacy of voluntary contributions by directing the levy of a
compulsory poor rate (No. 4), and in 1576 made the important innovation
of discriminating between persons unemployed because they could not get
work and persons unemployed because they did not want work, by enacting
that the former should be set to work on materials provided for them,
and that the latter should be committed to the House of Correction (No.
5). The system was completed by the Act for the Relief of the Poor of
1601 (No. 8). Its administration was in the hands of the Justices of the
Peace, who were much occupied with questions of settlement (Nos. 9, 10,
17), with carrying out instructions sent to them by the Privy Council
for relieving distress (Nos. 12 and 19), and with making reports to the
Privy Council of their proceedings (No. 18).</p>

<p>The provision of relief was never intended to be, and down to 1640 was
not, the sole method of coping with problems of distress. It was in its
origin associated with measures of a preventive character, attempts to
prevent the eviction of peasants (Part II, Section I, Nos. 9, 10, 13-17,
20 and 21), occasional attempts to raise wages (Part II, section III,
Nos. 10, 18, 19 and 20), attempts to prevent employers dismissing
workpeople in times of trade depression (No. 11), attempts to regulate
the price of food stuffs and to secure adequate supplies for the markets
(Nos. 2, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20). In the latter matter, as in many
others, the Tudor governments tried to make a regularly administered
national system out of what had for centuries been the practices of
local bodies. The Justices of the Peace were required in 1545 to inspect
barns<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span> and to compel the owners of supplies of grain to sell it in open
market (No. 3). Under Elizabeth the system was elaborated. The Justices
from time to time made returns to the Privy Council of the stocks of
grain available (No. 6), and of the prices ruling (No. 18); and
extremely detailed instructions for their guidance were drawn up by
Burleigh in 1586 (No. 7). The licensing of "Badgers," or dealers in
corn, was part of their regular business (Nos. 13 and 14); the movement
of grain from one district to another was carefully supervised (No. 15);
and engrossers and regrators were frequently brought before them (No.
16). The efficiency of the system depended very largely on the close
supervision of local government and economic affairs by the Privy
Council, and on the fact that offenders against public policy could be
tried before the Court of Star Chamber. One case before that Court is
printed below (No. 20). It is interesting as showing both the economic
ideas upon which the policy of regulating prices was based, and the way
in which attempts to supervise economic relationships brought the
government into collision with the interests of the middle and
commercial classes.</p>

<p>Forasmuch as it is come to the knowledge of our Sovereign Lord the King,
how that divers persons, as well his own subjects as others, having more
respect to their own private lucre and advantage than to the common weal
of this his Highness's realm, have by divers and sundry means
accumulated and got into their hands and possession a great number and
multitude of corn and grain, far above the necessary finding of their
households, sowing of their lands, paying their rent-corn and performing
of their lawful bargains of corn without fraud or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span> intrigue; and the
same of their covetous minds do wilfully detain and keep in their
possessions without bringing any part or parcel thereof into any market
to be sold, intending thereby for to cause the prices of corn to rise,
so that they may sell their corn and grain at such unreasonable prices
as they will themselves; by reason whereof the prices of corn and grains
... be raised to such excessive and high prices, that his Majesty's
loving subjects cannot gain with their great labours and pains
sufficient to pay for their convenient victuals and sustenance, and
worse are like to be hereafter, unless speedy remedy be provided in that
behalf; his Highness, therefore, by the advice of his said most
honourable council, and by authority of the said act of parliament made

commandeth all justices of peace ... within 20 days next ensuing the
publishing of this proclamation according to the said act, and oftener
after that by their discretions, to assemble themselves together ... and
that the said justices ... or two of them at the least, shall with all
convenient speed search the houses, barns and yards of such persons as
have been accustomed or used to sell corn and grain, and have abundance
of corn and grain more than shall be necessary for the sowing of their
lands, paying their rent-corn, performing their said lawful bargains of
corn, and finding of their houses until the feast of All Saints next
coming; and where they shall find any such abundance or surplus, shall
by their discretions straightly ... command in the name of our said
sovereign lord the king the owner or owners thereof to convey and bring
or cause to be brought such part and portion of their said corn and
grain unto the market or markets there near adjoining, or to have such
other market or markets, where they afore time have used or accustomed
to sell their corn there to be sold at, and during such time as shall be
thought meet by the said justices of the peace or two of them at the
least; the same justices delivering unto every of the said owner and
owners a bill subscribed with their hands, mentioning and declaring the
days, places, number and certainty of the bringing of the said corn and
grain to the said market and markets to be sold, as is aforesaid,
according to their said commandments and appointments; and if any person
or persons do wilfully refuse to convey or bring or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span> cause to be brought

to be advertized; that for a further proceeding in the accomplishment of
your honourable letters concerning the furnishing of the markets with
corn, we have according to our former letters of the ixth of June last,
met here together this day for conference therein. And perusing all our
notes and proceedings together, we find that throughout this shire by
such order as we have taken with owners and farmers and also badgers and
buyers of corn and grain, the markets are by them plentifully served
every market day with corn, and the same sold at reasonable rates, viz.
wheat at xxii<i>s.</i> the quarter, rye at xvi<i>s.</i>, malt at xiiii<i>s.</i> and
barley at xii<i>s.</i>, of which kinds of corn the poorer sort are by
persuasion served at meaner prices. And so we doubt not but it shall
likewise continue according to our direction until it shall please God
that new corn may be used. And hereof thinking it best in performance of
our duties to advertize your honours, we humbly take our leave. From

carefully seen unto to be relieved within their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span> several parishes,
hundreds or divisions, according to the law therefor provided, and that
where the provisions formerly made be not sufficient it may be now for
this time of dearth increased; and where one parish is not able to give
sufficient relief to such their poor, that parish to have the supply of
such parishes near adjoining as have fewer poor and are better able to
give relief, and that no vagabond or sturdy beggar, or any that may
otherwise get their living by their labours, be not suffered to wander
abroad under colour of begging in any town or highway, and that the
justices do presently give order that there be persons sufficiently
weaponed to assist the constables of every town to attach such vagabonds
both in their town-side and highways, and to commit them to prison
without bail, but as two of the justices of the peace near that division
shall order, and if the township shall not observe this order for the
attaching and punishment of the said vagabonds, then the justices shall
see due punishment by fine upon the whole township, or upon such parties
in the town as shall be found in fault.</p>

<p>That the justices of the peace do once every month certify their doings
and proceedings by force of these instructions unto the sheriff of the
said county, in which certificate they shall also make certificate of
such justices as shall be absent from any of these services, and the
true cause of their absence, and shall also certify the usual prices of
all kinds of grain in their markets for that month past, of all which
the same sheriff to certify the Privy Council once in every forty days
at the farthest, so as that default in any justice that shall be absent
may be duly considered and corrected by authority of his Majesty's
council as reason shall require, and so as such persons as are placed as
justices for their credit may not continue in those rooms, wherein they
shall be found not disposed to attend such a necessary and godly service
as this is, but others of better disposition may supply those rooms, if
there shall be need of any such number, as in most places is thought not
very needful, the number being in common opinion more hurtful than
profitable to justice.</p>

<p>And if any shall offend against the true meaning of these instructions,
or any part thereof, or shall use any sinister means to the defrauding
thereof, that such be severely punished according to the laws, and for
such obstinate persons as shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span> not conform themselves the justices
shall at their pleasure bind to appear before the Queen Majesty's Privy
Council by a day certain, there to be further dealt with by severe
punishment for the better ensample of all others....</p>

<p>There are divers poor people in the said parish which are a great
charge. Giles Cooke, not of our parish, married a widow's daughter
within our parish, which widow is poor and lives in a small cottage,
which is like to be a charge. Joan Whiple had lived 40 years and upward
in the parish with a brother, as a servant to him; and now that she has
grown old and weak he has put her off to the parish; she was taken
begging within the parish and was sent to Teddington, where she said she
was born, but that parish has sent her back again. Elzander Man, born in
Forthampton, in the county of Glou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>cester, married a wife within the
parish, who was received by her mother till she had two children; the
said wife is now dead, and he is gone into Gloucestershire and has left
his children to the keeping of the parish. Thomas Jones, born at
Harfield, in the county of Gloucester, married a wife within the parish,
and has two children; the said Jones being now gone, the parishioners
would know if they might send the woman to her husband, or to the place
where she or her husband was born.... Francis Gatfield has gone from the
parish, leaving his child and some goods and money; the child is left in
charge of the parish and the goods with his brother and sister; the
parishioners desire to know whether they may not avoid keeping the child
or seize the said goods towards its maintenance.</p>

in Bewdley, and there my wife doth yet dwell and in confines
thereabouts, and I send or bring my wife the best relief I am able, and
now the parish of Bewdley will not suffer her to dwell there for doubt
of further charge. Right worshipful, I most humbly crave your good aid
and help in this my distress, or else my poor wife and child are like to
perish without the doors. And this, right worshipful, I do humbly crave,
that by your good help and order to the parish of Stockton I may have a

<p>We do hereby require you to call before you such clothiers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span> as you shall
think fitting, and to deal effectually with them for the employment of
such weavers, spinners and other persons as are now out of work, where
we may not omit to let you know, that as we have employed our best
endeavours in favour of the clothiers both for the vent of their cloth
and for moderation in the price of wool (of which we hope they shall
speedily find the effects), so may we not endure that the clothiers in
that or any other county should at their pleasure, and without giving
knowledge thereof unto this Board, dismiss their workfolks, who, being
many in number and most of them of the poorer sort, are in such cases
likely by their clamours to disturb the quiet and government of those
parts wherein they live. And if there shall be found greater numbers of
poor people than the clothiers can receive and employ, we think it fit
and accordingly require you to take order for putting the statute in
execution, whereby there is provision made in that behalf by raising of
public stocks for the employment of such in that trade as want work.
Wherein if any clothier shall after sufficient warning refuse or neglect
to appear before you, or otherwise shall obstinately deny to yield to
such overtures in this case as shall be reasonable and just, you shall
take good bonds of them for refusing to appear before us, and
immediately certify their names unto this Board ...; this being the rule
by which both the woolgrower, the clothier and merchant must be
governed, that whosoever had a part of the gain in profitable times
since his Majesty's happy reign, must now in the decay of trade ... bear
a part of the public losses as may best conduce to the good of the
public and the maintenance of the general trade.</p>

<p>Whereas we by special directions of his Majesty did lately commend unto
your care the present state of those parts of your county where the poor
clothiers and their workmen at present destitute of work might some
other way be employed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span> or for the time be relieved till some
obstructions to trade were removed, as also to keep in order those that
are loose and ill disposed people; to which end his Majesty, by advice
of his Privy Council and the Judges, hath lately published a
proclamation declaring his pleasure and command in what manner the truly
poor and impotent should be relieved, those of able bodies should be set
on work and employed in honest labour, and the sturdy, idle and
dangerous rogues and vagabonds should be repressed and punished, which
proclamation you shall herewith likewise receive; now, because we
understand that in your county there is more than ordinary occasion to
use all diligence and industry at this time, we have thought fit to put
you more particularly in mind thereof, and in answer of your letters to
let you know that it is the resolution of all the judges, that by the
law you have sufficient power and ought to raise means out of the
several parishes, if they be of ability, or otherwise in their defect,
in their several hundreds, lathes or wapentakes, and for want of their
ability (to set your poor on work and to relieve the aged and impotent
not able to work) in the whole body of the county; wherefore his Majesty
commands that the ways provided by law in these cases be duly followed
with all diligence and possible speed. You are required to understand
the true state of the country from the ministers, churchwardens and
overseers of the several parishes within your several divisions. And
what rests herein to be done by order at the quarter sessions, the
judges advise that for this purpose you may call the quarter sessions
sooner then the ordinary set times, and do that which in this case is so
requisite.</p>

<p>Further we let you to know, that such hath been his Majesty's care and
personal pains taken to remove these impediments that of late have been
to trade, and to open a free vent to the commodities of your country,
that yourselves will shortly see the fruits of it to your comforts;
nevertheless in the meantime these things provided by the law, and the
helps that by your care may be added, are in no sort to be neglected,
but exactly pursued; of which your proceedings we, are to be advertised
that so we may render account thereof to his Majesty.</p>

<p>And so, etc.</p>

now last past, three years whereof he served as a labouring servant, and

Wirksworth Wapentake.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 5em;">To Francis Bradshawe, Esq., High Sheriff of the County of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Derby.</span><br />
<br />
Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>In pursuit of the orders and directions given us in command as well by
the printed book as also by several letters sent unto us from the right
honourable the lords of her Majesty's most honourable Privy Council, we,
whose names are hereunder written, having within our allotment the
wapentake or hundred of Wirksworth, have had monthly meetings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span> within
the said hundred and have summoned both the high constable, petty
constables, churchwardens, and overseers of the poor within that
division and hundred to appear before us.</p>

<p>1. And first we have made diligent inquiry how all the said officers and
others have done their duties in execution of the laws mentioned in the
Commission, and what persons have offended against any of them, and
punished such as we have found faulty.</p>

<p>2. We have taken care that the lords and parishioners of every town
relieve the poor thereof, and they are not suffered to straggle or beg
up and down either in their parishes or elsewhere. But such poor as have
transgressed have been punished according to law, and the impotent poor
there are carefully relieved. We have also taken especial care that both
the stewards of leets and ourselves in particular have taken care for
the reformation of abuses in bakers, alehousekeepers, breaking of
assize, forestallers and regrators, against tradesmen of all sorts for
selling with underweight, and have made search in market towns and other
places and taken away and burned very many false weights and measures,
and taken order for the punishing of the said offenders.</p>

<p>3. We have made special inquiry of such poor children as are fit to be
bound apprentices to husbandry and otherwise, and of such as are fit to
take apprentices, and therein we have taken such course as by law is
required. And we find none refuse to take apprentices, being thereunto
required.</p>

<p>4. We do not find upon our inquiry that the statute for labourers and
ordering of wages is deluded, and the common fashion of none essoyning
of course is restrained.</p>

<p>5. The weekly taxations for relief of the poor in these times of
scarcity is raised to higher rates, and we have further observed the
course appointed in the fifth article.</p>

<p>6. We have taken order the petty constables within our said division are
chosen of the ablest parishioners.</p>

<p>7. Watches in the night and warding by day are appointed in every town
for apprehension of rogues and for good order, and we have taken order
to punish such as we have found faulty.</p>

<p>8. We have taken care that the high constable doth his duty in
presenting to us the defaults of the petty constables<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span> for not punishing
the rogues and in presenting to us the defaulters.</p>

<p>9. We find none presented to us that live out of service and refuse to
work for reasonable wages.</p>

<p>10. We have one House of Correction at Ashborn within our wapentake,
which is near the town prison, where such as are committed are kept to
work.</p>

<p>11. We have punished several persons for harbouring rogues in their
barns and outhouses, and have observed the further directions of the
11th article.</p>

<p>12. We have had care to see that all defects and defaults in the
amending of highways be redressed, and the defaulters have been
presented to the next quarter sessions and punished.</p>

<p>And as touching their lordships' letters and orders directed concerning
corn and enclosures, we do at our monthly meetings take a strict account
that the former orders therein taken by us in pursuit thereof be duly
observed and put in execution, and particularly none sell such corn (as
they are appointed to sell out of the market) but to the poor of the
said parish. And neither the petty constable nor any other officer can
(as they inform us) present any engrossers of corn, etc., or
forestallers of markets.</p>

<p>The prices of corn (considering the times) are not on our markets in our
opinion unreasonable, but are as follow, viz., wheat for the strike
5<i>s.</i>, four peck making a strike, rye 4<i>s.</i>, barley 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, malt
5<i>s.</i>, peas 4<i>s.</i>, oats 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>We have made especial inquiry touching enclosures made within these two
years, but find very few within our division, for the most of our
wapentake hath been long since enclosed. Howsoever some few hath been
presented, which we have commanded to throw down, and have stayed the
proceedings of such enclosures as have been lately begun and are not
finished.</p>

<p>We have no maltmakers in this wapentake but for their own use.</p>

<p>We have put down a full third part of all the alehouses within this
wapentake; yet there are so great a multitude of poor miners within this
wapentake that we are enforced to leave more alehousekeepers than
otherwise we would.</p>

<p>We have taken order for the binding all cooks, alehousekeepers,
victuallers and butchers within this hundred that they neither dress nor
suffer to be dressed or eaten any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span> flesh during the time of Lent or
other days prohibited, and our recognizances to that purpose do remain
with the Clerk of the Peace, to be by him certified according to the
statute.</p>

<p>Whereas we have been made acquainted with a letter written by John
Wildbore, a Minister in and about Tinwell within that county, to a
friend of his here, wherein after some mention by him made of the
present want and misery sustained by the poorer sort in those parts
through the dearth of corn and the want of work, he doth advertize in
particular some speeches uttered by a shoemaker of Uppingham (whose name
we find not) tending to the stirring up of the poor thereabout to a
mutiny and insurrection; which information was as followeth, <i>in h&aelig;c
verba</i>: "Hearest thou?" saith a shoemaker of Uppingham to a poor man of
Liddington, "If thou wilt be secret I will make a motion to thee." "What
is your motion?" saith the other. Then said the shoemaker, "The poor men
of Okeham have sent to us poor men of Uppingham, and if you poor men of
Liddington will join with us, we will rise, and the poor of Okeham say
they can have all the armour of the country in their power within half
an hour, and in faith (saith he) we will rifle the churls." Upon
consideration had thereof, however this Board is not easily credulous of
light reports nor apt to take impression from the vain speeches or
ejaculations of some mean and contemptible persons; yet because it sorts
well with the care and providence of a state to prevent all occasions
which ill-affected persons may otherwise lay hold of under pretence and
colour of the necessity of the time, we have thought good hereby to will
and require you, the Deputy Lieuts. and Justices of peace next
adjoining, forthwith to apprehend and take a more particular examination
as well of the said shoemaker as of such others as you shall think fit
concerning the advertizement aforesaid; and that you take especial care
that the arms of that county in and about those parts be safely disposed
of; and likewise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span> (which is indeed most considerable and the best means
to prevent all disorders in this kind) that you deal effectually in
causing the market to be well supplied with corn and the poor to be
served at reasonable prices and set on work by those of the richer sort,
and by raising of stock to relieve and set them on work according to the
laws. All which we recommend to your especial care, and require an
account from you of your doings and proceedings herein with all
convenient expedition.</p>

<p>And so, etc.</p>

[<i>Camden Society. Cases in the Courts of Star Chamber and High
Commission, edited by S.R. Gardiner</i>], 1631.</p>

<p class='center'><i>In Camera Stellata, Michaelmas, 7<sup>o</sup> Caroli.</i></p>

<p>One Archer of Southchurch in Essex was brought <i>ore tenus</i>, being then
charged by Mr. Attorney-General for keeping in his corn, and
consequently for enhancing the price of corn the last year, which
offence Mr. Attorney affirmed to be of high nature and evil consequence,
to the undoing of the poor and <i>malum in se</i>, and then desired his
examination taken before the Lord Keeper might be read. His examination
purported that he had seen at the time of his examining a presentment
that was made against him by the Grand Jury at the last Assizes in Essex
before Justice Vernon for the said offence of keeping in his corn and
enhancing; and for that he had made a bargain to sell the poor of the
town where he dwelled rye for 7<i>s.</i> a bushell, and afterwards refused to
perform his bargain unless he might have nine shillings a bushell: he
denied his bargain, but for his excuse said, he sold to the towns about
him for the poor, wheat at 7<i>s.</i> and 8<i>s.</i> a bushell, and at the latter
end of the year for 5<i>s.</i>, and rye for 7<i>s.</i> and 6<i>s.</i>, etc., and some
for 3<i>s.</i> and 6<i>d.</i> the bushell. He confessed he kept in his corn till
June, and that he had 8 quarters of wheat, 60 quarters of rye, and 100
quarters of oats, and that his family were himself and his wife and
daughters, two maids, and a man; he confessed that he sold none or very
little of his corn in Rochford hundred where he dwelt, though he were
commanded so to do by the Earl of Warwick; yet for his defence he
further alleged that his barn was not visited by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span> any justices or
officers according to his Majesty's late proclamation and orders for
that purpose, and that he had no notice of the said proclamation and
orders; lastly, he confessed he sold most of his corn at London and
Chelmsford, and that he bought his seed corn out of market, etc. His
examination aforesaid was shewed to him and he confessed it to be true,
and acknowledged his hand thereunto subscribed before it was read in
court; and it being read, the Lord Keeper demanded of Archer what he
could there say for himself, and what answer he would make to this
accusation. The said Archer saith that he could make no other answer
than he had made in his examination, and submitted himself to the mercy
of the Court.</p>

<p>Mr. Attorney desired that their Lordships would proceed to sentence the
said Archer according to his desert, and withall prayed that a precedent
of a sentence given in the Star Chamber in the 29 and 30 of Queen
Elizabeth against one Framingham of Norfolk in the like case might be
read before their Lordships gave their sentence in this cause; and it
was read. The said Framingham was accused upon his own confession in
this Court <i>ore tenus</i> for destroying of husbandry in making cottages of
his tenants' houses, taking away the land and letting it lie to pasture
in his own hands, and letting the cottages at dear rates, and
forstalling the markets, and enhancing the prices of corn, whereupon he
was fined 500<i>l.</i> to the Queen, and ordered to pay 40<i>l.</i> to the poor,
and to stand upon a stool in Cheapside with a paper on his head
declaring his offence, and to lay his land again to the cottages, and to
let them at reasonable rates.</p>

<p>Justice Harvey delivered his opinion, that whereas it hath pleased God
to send a plentiful year, and yet the price of corn continued very high,
himself and the rest of the Justices of the Peace that were in the last
Quarter Sessions in Hertfordshire assembled, did advise among themselves
how they might deal with the country to bring down the price, but they
were afraid to meddle with any thing upon experience of their ill-taking
what was so well intended by his Majesty, that by the late orders,
thereupon taking occasion to go on and raise the prices of corn higher;
he was of opinion that this man's punishment or example will do a great
deal more good than all their orders which they might have made at the
Sessions;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span> and therefore he declared his offence to be very great, and
fit to be punished in this Court; and adjudged him to pay 100 marks fine
to the King, and 10<i>l.</i> to the poor, and to stand upon the pillory in
Newgate Market an hour with a paper, wherein the cause of his standing
there was to be written, put upon his hat, "For enhancing the price of
corn"; and then to be led through Cheapside to Leadenhall Market, and
there likewise to stand upon the pillory one hour more with the same
paper upon his hat, and after this to be sent to Chelmsford, and there
likewise in the market to stand upon the pillory.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Richardson affirmed this offence to be an offence at the
common law long before the King's proclamation and orders, and also
against some statutes, that his keeping in his corn and not bringing it
into the next markets by little and little as he ought to have done, and
selling it at other markets when the price was as high as he would have
it, was an enhancing the price of corn, and that the Justices in Essex
did at the common law inquire of such enhancing the price of any
victuals, and corn was certainly victual, bread the staff of man's life,
and that keeping in of his corn in this manner was enhancing the prices
of corn, which is punishable by the statute as well as forestallings,
and approved of his Majesty's pious and honourable care for his people.
Also he observed in the defendant's confession that he was guilty of
forestalling the market, in buying seed corn out of market and not
bringing so much of his own to supply the same in the next market. He
therefore condemned the said Archer to be guilty of the said offences,
and agreed in his said fine to the King, and would have him pay as much
to the poor as the 100 marks wanted of 100<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The Bishop of London<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> observed with Mr. Attorney that this was
<i>malum in se</i>, and that this Archer was guilty of a most foul offence,
which the Prophet hath in a very energetical phrase, "grinding the faces
of the poor." He commended highly that speech of Justice Harvey, that
this last year's famine was made by man and not by God, solicited by the
hard-heartedness of men, and commended this observation as being made by
his Majesty. And thereupon undertook to clear the wisdom of the Church,
in ordaining to pray to God that he would be pleased to turn his
scarcity and dearth, which cruel men (but He never) made, through His
goodness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span> and mercy into cheapness and plenty. He said that God taketh
away the hardness and cruelty of men's hearts, which was the cause of
the famine or scarcity, and He only; and therefore the Church hath very
wisely ordained as aforesaid. He is glad to hear it declared to be an
offence against the common law of this realm; and, therefore, seeing it
had pleased God to load the earth so richly, and also to send so dry a
time for the inning the same in the harvest, for, if that had wanted,
all that abundance had been but an uncomfortable load, as we by our sins
had deserved and was threatened, and yet for all this plenty corn was at
an extreme rate, and they boast among themselves now they can keep their
corn as long as they list and no fear of moulding, he thinks fit this
man be made an example that others may fear to offend in the like kind.
And assenteth to his fine to be 100 marks, and thinks fit, seeing he
hath ground the faces of the poor, he should therefore help to seal them
again, and pay 10<i>l.</i> to the poor; and the rest of the former sentence
he assented unto. The Earl of Danby consented to the sentence in all,
adding that he should pay but 10<i>l.</i> to the poor, and to stand likewise
upon the pillory at the Palace, because some of all countries might take
notice thereof.</p>

<p>The Earl of Dorset concurred in his sentence with the Earl of Danby, and
commended my Lord Keeper and Mr. Attorney for their care and pains in
bringing him to justice, and wished that inquiry should be made if the
Justices of the Peace had made default in not visiting the said Archer's
barns. But as for the Earl of Warwick, Sir Thomas Richardson had well
declared that Lords and Peers of the Parliament were exempted from the
services of the said orders, and yet that the Lord of Warwick out of his
care had admonished him, etc.</p>

<p>Lord Privy Seal gave his sentence in few words, that Archer was guilty
by his own confession of a very great offence, and well worthy the
sentence aforesaid, and in full consented to it.</p>

<p>The Lord Keeper did affirm that it was indeed a good work to bring this
man forth to be here sentenced, but that it was brought about by means
of Justice Vernon, who informed him of the said Archer as being the only
man presented in all his circuit for offending in this kind, and that to
him this was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span> to be attributed. He was of opinion, that the said Archer
was guilty of enhancing the price of corn by keeping in his corn, as is
confessed, in this time of scarcity, which was not a scarcity made by
God (for there was enough to be had at dear prices and high rates). He
affirmed the same to be an offence as well against the common law as
against some statutes, and also he would not leave out against his
Majesty's proclamation and orders, for his Lordship held there was an
aggravation to his offence. And his Lordship declared further (and
wished it might be taken notice of, as well as of what had already been
spoken, for that much had been said that day of singular use and benefit
for the commonwealth), that these were no new opinions. And to that
purpose showed that in the old charge to the quest of inquiry in the
King's Bench, this enhancing the prices, not only of corn but of any
other commodities, was inquirable and to be there punished; also [he]
cited a statute whereby those that agree to keep up the price of any
commodities, agreeing to sell all at one price, and those that raise
false news to bring down the price of any commodities from what they are
justly worth, are punishable; as those that raised news that there were
great wars beyond sea, and there would be no vent for cloth, and told
the same in the country at Coxsall, for that the prices of wools fell
there, and they were punished for it. And his Lordship vouched a
precedent of one for procuring the raising the price of a certain
commodity, for which he was informed against in the King's Bench, and
though his Counsel alleged that he had done nothing, he had but spoken,
and his offence was in words only, yet he was adjudged an enhancer for
but advising the same. And [he] vouched a statute or proclamation in the
time of H. 8 for setting the prices on corn, and the like orders and
proclamations in the times of E. 6, Queen Eliz. and King James, and
agreed it to be well spoken by the Earl of Dorset, that if any shall do
any thing tending to depopulation, over and besides his punishment, he
shall be enjoined to populate as much, as the said Framingham was: and
vouched a book case, where one complaining against another for letting
down a sea wall, so that not only his, but diverse other men's grounds
were surrounded, the judgment was given in the common pleas that the
plaintiff should recover his damages, and the defendant should also make
up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span> said wall at his costs and charges. And thereupon his said
Lordship consented to the highest censure against the said Archer for
his forestalling the market and keeping in his corn to the enhancing of
the price, to the great hurt of the common people, especially the poor
labourer: and committed Archer to the Fleet from whence he came.</p>

<p>The attempts made between 1405 and 1660 to develop industry and commerce
are usually known as "the Mercantile System." But the name is an
unfortunate one. The mercantile system was not specially mercantile;
for, as preceding sections have shown, government interference was not
confined to matters of commerce; nor was it a system, but a collection
of opportunist expedients, nearly all of which had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span> been tried in
preceding centuries. It is true, however, that after the accession of
Elizabeth, the efforts already made under Henry VII and Henry VIII to
foster commerce (<i>see</i> Schanz, <i>Englische Handelspolitik gegen Ende des
Mittelalters</i>) were carried on with greater persistency and
deliberation. It is from this period, therefore, that the documents in
this section are principally drawn.</p>

<p>The most pressing economic problem in the middle of the sixteenth
century was the fall in the value of money, caused, principally, by the
influx of silver from America, but to a less extent by the debasement of
the currency, which led to a rise in prices (No. 3), and a disturbance
of the foreign exchanges (Nos. 4 and 5), and which could be met to some
small extent by calling in the base coin (Nos. 4 and 5). This the
government did in 1560. In 1570, in its anxiety to prevent the efflux of
bullion, it took steps to impose a special tax on all exchange
transactions, but such a tax was really a tax on banking, and its
consequences, according to the business houses concerned, were
disastrous (No. 6). The most certain way, however, of securing adequate
supplies of bullion was thought to consist in checking imports and
encouraging exports (Nos. 3 and 5); and the policy was strengthened by
other considerations (No. 3). The general policy under Elizabeth was to
discourage imports in order to prevent unemployment at home (Nos. 3 and
7), to encourage corn-growing by allowing the export of wheat, except in
times of scarcity, on payment of a small duty (Nos. 3 and 10), and to
encourage the export of manufactured articles rather than of raw
materials, especially the export of dyed and finished cloth (Nos. 3, 8,
11 and 12), any interruption of which caused distress (No. 13). The
policy which had been pursued under Henry VIII threatened the vested
interests of the Merchants Adventurers, who complained that they could
not find markets for finished cloth (No. 2). In the reign of James I a
more ambitious attempt was made in the same direction, and in 1614, when
the abrupt dissolution of Parliament had left the government in
financial difficulties, a plan was initiated for preventing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
exportation of cloths not dyed and dressed in England. As the Merchant
Adventurers refused to be a party to it, a new company was established
to carry on the desired trade, and was granted a charter in 1616 (No.
16). The result of this policy was a tariff war with the Netherlands and
acute distress at home, and, after various suggestions for reviving
trade had been made (No. 17), the abandonment of the undertaking. The
political motives of mercantilism, as well as its economic aims, are
illustrated by Strafford's account of his policy in Ireland (No. 21). Of
more enduring importance, perhaps, than mercantilist schemes were the
development of Joint-Stock Companies (No. 9), the expansion of
commercial enterprize (No. 11), and the attempts to establish colonies
(No. 12).</p>

<p>Among the methods for fostering industry, and incidentally for raising
an unparliamentary revenue, the granting of patents and monopolies holds
an important place. These patents ranged from grants of the sole conduct
of important industries (Nos. 14 and 18) to grants of trifling offices
of profit and pensions (Nos. 14 and 22). The reaction against the
interference of the Crown with trade is excellently expressed in the
report of the Committee on "the Bill for Free Trade" (No. 15), a
document which, in spite of the fact that the Bill was dropped, is of
the highest economic and constitutional importance (<i>see</i> Gardiner, Vol.
I, pp. 188-190). It is concerned primarily with monopolies enjoyed by
trading companies, such as the Company of Merchant Adventurers, the
Eastland Company, and the Russia Company. But its arguments apply <i>a
fortiori</i> to patents granted to individuals, and throw much light on the
nature of the economic opposition to the Stuarts. The effect of the
attitude of Parliament was seen later in the Act abolishing internal and
local restrictions on the trade in woollen cloths (No. 20), in the
Statute of Monopolies (No. 19), and in the revocation by Charles in 1639
of patents granted during the period of personal government (No. 22).
The place occupied by monopolies in the Stuarts' fiscal system was
later, when the Civil War began, partially filled by the Excise (No.
23).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>

<p>The King to all to whom, etc., greeting. It is manifest to us by
inspection of the rolls of our Chancery that the lord Henry the Seventh,
late King of England, our dearest grand father, caused his letters
patent to be made in these words:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry by the grace of God King of England and France and Lord of
Ireland, to all to whom the present letters shall come, greeting. Be it
known and manifest that we have given and granted, and by these presents
we do give and grant for us and our heirs to our beloved John Cabot,
citizen of Venice, and Lewis, Sebastian and Sanctus, sons of the said
John, and the heirs and deputies of them and every of them, full and
free authority, faculty and power to sail to all parts, regions and
gulfs of the sea, east, west and north, under our banners, standards,
and ensigns, with five ships or boats of whatsoever portage or kind they
be, and with as many sailors and men as they wish to take with them in
the said ships at their own and the others' costs and expenses, to find,
discover and search out any isles, countries, regions or provinces of
heathens and infidels whomsoever set in any part of the world soever,
which have been before these times unknown to all Christians. We have
granted also to the same and to every of them and to the heirs and
deputies of them and every of them, and given licence for them to affix
our aforesaid banners and ensigns in any town, castle, isle or solid
land soever newly found by them; and that the aforenamed John and his
sons or heirs and the deputies of the same may subjugate, occupy and
possess any such towns, castles and islands found by them which can be
subjugated, occupied and possessed, as our vassals and governors,
lieutenants and deputies of the same, acquiring for us the lordship,
title and jurisdiction of the same towns, castles, islands and solid
land so found; so, nevertheless, that of all fruits, profits,
emoluments, commodities, gains and obventions arising from such voyages,
the aforesaid John and his sons and heirs and their deputies be held and
bound to pay to us for every voyage, as often as they touch at our port
of Bristol, at which alone they are held and bound to touch, after
deducting the necessary costs and expenses made by them, a fifth part of
their capital gain made whether in wares or in money; giving and
granting to them and their heirs and deputies that they be free and
immune from all payment of customs on all and singular goods and wares
which they bring back with them from those places so newly found. And
further we have given and granted to the same and to their heirs and
deputies that all lands, farms, isles, towns, castles and places
whatsoever found by them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span> as many as shall be found by them, may not be
frequented or visited by any other our subjects soever without licence
of the aforesaid John and his sons and their deputies, under pain of
loss as well of the ships or boats as of all goods whatsoever presuming
to sail to those places so found; willing and most straitly commanding
all and singular our subjects set as well on land as on sea that they
give good assistance to the aforesaid John and his sons and deputies and
show all their favour and aid as well in manning the ships or boats as
in provision of equipment and victuals to be bought for their money and
all other things to be provided for them to be taken for the said
voyage. In witness whereof we have caused these our letters patent to be
made. Witness myself at Westminster, 5 April in the 11th year of our
reign.</p>

<p>And we, because the letters aforesaid have been lost by mischance, as
the aforesaid Sebastian, appearing in person before us in our Chancery,
has taken a corporal oath, and that he will restore those letters to us
into the same our Chancery to be cancelled there, if he shall find them
hereafter, have deemed fit to exemplify by these presents the tenour of
the enrolment of the letters aforesaid, at the request of the same
Sebastian. In witness whereof these our letters, etc. Witness the King

Undressed Cloth</span> [<i>Br. M. Cotton MS. Tib. D. VIII, f. 40</i><a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>],
1514-1536.</p>

<p>Considerations alleged by the governor and fellowship of merchant
adventurers to prove how it were more for the universal wealth of the
realm of England to convey and send over the sea to the markets
accustomed cloths of all prices, not dressed nor shorn, than cloths
dressed and shorn.</p>

<p>First it is to be noted, marked and considered, that in few years after
the act of Parliament made, that no sort of cloths draped and made
within the realm of England being above the price of five marks sterling
the piece should be conveyed over the sea undressed and unshorn, the
same sort of cloths, which at that day were bought for five marks, be
now at this present day by the industry of the said merchants uttering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
the said cloths sold within the realm for four pounds sterling, which is
a great enriching of the whole realm, so that the said merchants think
it to stand with reason and conscience, that those sort of cloths, of
four pounds the piece, ought to be reputed and taken, in regard of the
act, after cloths of five marks the piece.</p>

<p><i>Item</i> the merchants of those parts buying English cloths will in no
wise meddle with any cloths, that be dressed, unless they may have them
at a price far under the foot; for it is in experience daily, that the
merchants of England conveying over the sea a sort of cloths every of
them being of like length and goodness, whereof the one half of them
have dressed and shorn and the other half undressed and unshorn, the
said merchants shall sell those cloths being undressed five shillings
dearer in every cloth, than those that be dressed; also those cloths
undressed be meet and ready for every man and the other dressed but only
for one man, so that against one cloth dressed the merchants of England
shall sell five hundred undressed, whereby it appeareth, that it were
for the common weal and great enriching to the realm of England to send
over into those parts all sorts of cloths undressed and but a singular
and private wealth to dress any such cloths; for there be many more in
number, that live by making of cloths and selling of the same, than
there be that live by dressing of cloths.</p>

<p><i>Item</i> the common people of those parts, by whom the most part of those
cloths be consumed, do use in their garments sundry colours not
accustomed to be worn here in England, which colours cannot be made,
unless they buy their cloths undressed; for the dressing of cloths here
and there vary and alter so much, that the dressing will take in manner
none of their colours. And in case the merchants of England should bring
over such cloths dressed, they should not only be undone in the sale of
them, but also it were to be doubted, that in brief time after they
would wholly relinquish the buying and wearing of any English cloths in
those parts, which God defend.</p>

<p><i>Item</i> there be certain coarse cloths named long Glemsters, and
notwithstanding their coarseness the King's Grace is paid for a cloth
and a third part in his custom; and if the buyer will cut off 6 or 8
yards of the said cloth, he may lawfully convey it over notwithstanding
the act, which should be a great loss in the sale and an occasion that
the strangers should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span> not buy them, wherefore the said governor and
merchants say, that the said cloths ought of right to pass for cloths
under five marks the piece.</p>

<p><i>Item</i> at this present day, our Lord be thanked, there is shipped and
conveyed out of England into those parts more number of cloths of all
sorts and there uttered sold and consumed, than ever hath been in memory
of man; and considering, cloth is now there in such high estimation and
hath so good vent, the said merchants think, under correction, that it
were not necessary, but an utter peril and danger, to attempt them to
any other purpose to alter them out of this good trade, which our Lord
continue.</p>

<p><i>Item</i> the inhabitants of those parts by the make of English cloths in
frieze consume, waste and spend a great quantity and number of them,
which frieze undoubtedly after their using and wearing cannot be made of
English cloths dressed here, so that by the only means thereof it should
be a great diminution and decay to the common weal of this realm, if the
said act for dressing of cloths should take place or effect.</p>

<p><i>Item</i> the inhabitants of the realm of England have the buying and
selling of the wool, one with another, they have also the carding,
spinning, weaving, fulling and the first sale of such cloths, and the
inhabitants of those parts have only the dressing and shearing of
certain of the said cloths, whereby the inhabitants there been a little
relieved and a few number of them for a time set to work; yet by means
thereof the rulers and honest burgesses of the towns be desirous to have
the nation of England to haunt their said towns, and entertain them with
much familiarity and friendship. And it is much to be feared and
doubted, that if the realm of England should all covet and they to have
no relief nor comfort by the same, that they of Antwerp and other
places, studying their common weal, would not only find means ways and
occasions to expel the nation from them, but also that no English cloths
should be there consumed nor sold, which our Lord defend.</p>

<p><i>f. 17b-f. 20.</i></p>

<p><i>Knight.</i> How can that be? What maketh it the matter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span> what sort of coin
we have amongst ourselves, so it be current from one hand to another,
yea, if it were made of leather?</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Ye see, men commonly say so; but the truth is contrary; as not
only I could prove by common reason, but also that proof and experience
hath already declared the same. But now we do not reason of the causes
of these griefs, but what state of men be grieved indeed by this dearth
of things; and albeit I find every man grieved by it in one thing or
other, yet considering that, as many of them as have wares to sell, do
enhance as much in the price of all things that they sell as was
enhanced before in the price of things that they must buy; as the
merchant, if he buy dear, he will sell dear again. So the artificers, as
cappers, clothiers, shoemakers and farriers, have respect large enough,
in selling their wares, to the price of victual, wool and iron, which
they buy. I have seen a cap for 14<i>d.</i>, as good as I can get now for
2<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>; of cloth ye have heard how the price is risen. Then a pair
of shoes costeth me 12<i>d.</i> now, that I have in my days bought a better
for 6<i>d.</i> Then I can get never a horse shod under 10<i>d.</i> or 12<i>d.</i>
[now], where I have seen the common price was 6<i>d.</i> for shoeing of a
horse round, yea, and 8<i>d.</i> (at the most) till now of late. I cannot,
therefore, understand that these men have greatest grief by this common
and universal dearth, but rather such as have their livings and stipends
rated at a certainty, as common labourers at 6<i>d.</i> the day, journeymen
of all occupations, serving men [at] 40<i>s.</i> the year, and gentlemen
whose lands are let out by them or their ancestors either for lives or
for term of years, so as they can not enhance the rent thereof though
they would, and yet have the price enhanced by them of every thing that
they buy. Yea the King's Highness, whereof we spake nothing all this
while, as he hath most of yearly revenues and that certain, so hath he
most lost by this dearth, and by the alteration especially of the coin.
For like as a man, that hath a great number of servants under him, if he
would grant that they should pay him [pins] weekly where [before] they
paid him [pence], I think he should be most loser himself. So we be all
but gatherers for the King's Majesty, that be his subjects; we have but
every man a poor living; the clear gains cometh for the most [part] to
the King's grace. Now if his Grace do take of us the overplus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span> of our
getting in this new coin, where he was wont to be paid in other good
coin, I report me to you whether that will go as far as the other, in
proportion of his necessaries and of the Realm. I think plainly no; for
though his Highness might, within his own realm, have things at his own
price, as his Grace can not indeed without great grudge of his
magistrates and subjects; yea, since his Majesty must have from beyond
the seas many things necessary not only for his Grace's household and
ornaments, as well for his grace's person and family, as of his horses,
which [percase] might be by his Grace somewhat moderated, but also for
the furniture of his wars, which by no means can be spared; as armour,
and all kinds of artillery, anchors, cables, pitch, tar, iron, steel,
handguns, gunpowder, and many other things more than I can reckon, which
his Grace must needs buy from beyond the seas, at the price the stranger
will set him them at. I pass over the enhancement of the charges of his
Grace's household, which is common to his grace with all other noble
men. [Therefore], I say, his Majesty hath most loss, by this common
dearth, of all other; and not only loss, but danger to the Realm and all
his subjects, if his Grace should want treasure to purchase the said
habiliments and necessaries for war, or to find soldiers in time of
need, which passeth all other private losses that we spake of.</p>

<p><i>Capper.</i> We hear say, that the King's Majesty maketh up his losses that
way by the gains which he hath by the mint another way. If that be too
short, he supplieth that lack by subsidies and impositions of his
subjects, so as his Grace can not lack, so long as his subjects have it.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> You say well there. So long as the subjects have it, so it is
meet the King should have it; but what and they have it not? for they
cannot have it, when there is no treasure left within the realm. And as
touching the mint I account the profit much like as if a man would take
his wood up by the roots, to make [the more profit thereof at one time,
and ever after to lose] the profit that might grow thereof yearly, or to
pull the wool of his sheep by the root. And as for the subsidies; how
can they be large when the subjects have little to depart with? and yet
that way of gathering treasure is not always most safe for the prince's
surety; for we see many times the profits of such subsidies spent in
appeasing of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span> the people that are moved to sedition partly by occasion
of the same....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>f. 31b-f. 34.</i></p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Mary, the first way [<i>sc.</i> to equalize the profits of tillage
and pasture-farming] is to make that wool be of as base a price [to] the
breeder thereof as the corn is; and that shall be, if you make alike
restraint of wools, for passing over the sea unwrought, as ye make of
corn. Ye have a law made that no corn shall pass over and it be above a
noble a quarter; if it be under ye give free liberty for it to pass
over; let wool be restrained likewise, for passing over, so long as it
is above 12<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> the tod; and when it is under let it have free
passage; that is one way. Another is, to increase the custom of wool
that passeth over unwrought; and by that the price of it shall be based
to the breeders, and yet the price over the sea shall be never the less.
But that is increased in the price thereof [on] strangers shall come
unto the King's Highness; which is as profitable to the Realm as though
it came to the breeders, and might relieve them of their subsidies. Thus
far as touching the bringing down the price of wools; now to the
enhancing of the same price in corn, to be as equivalent to the
husbandman as wool should be. And that might be brought to pass if ye
will let it have as free passage over sea at all times, as ye have now
for wool.</p>

<p><i>Merchant.</i> By the first two ways men would send less wool over sea than
they do now; and, by that way, the King's customs and profits of his
staple should be minished; by your latter way, the price of corn should
be much enhanced, wherewith men should be much grieved.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> I wot well it would be dear at the first; but if I can
persuade you that it were reasonable it were so, and that the same could
be no hindrance to the Realm universally, but great profit to the same,
then I think we would be content it should be so; and as touching the
King's custom, I will speak afterward.</p>

<p><i>Merchant.</i> I will grant, if you can show me that.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> I will essay it, albeit the matter be somewhat intricate, and
as I showed you before, at the first face will displease many; for they
will say, Would you make corn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span> dearer than it is? Have you dearth enough
else without that? Nay I pray you find means to have it better cheap, if
it may be, it is dear enough already; and such other like reasons would
be said. But now let the husbandman answer such men again. Have not the
grazers raised the price of your wools and pelts? and you merchant men,
clothiers and cappers, raised the price of your merchandize and wares
over it was wont to be in manner double? Is it not as good reason then I
should raise the price of my corn? What reason is it that you should be
at large, and I to be restrained? Either let us all be restrained
together, or else let us all be at like liberty. Ye may sell [your wool]
over the sea, your fells, your tallow, your cheese, your butter, your
leather, which riseth all by grazings, at your pleasure, and that for
the dearest penny ye can get for them. And I shall not send out my corn,
except it be at 10<i>d.</i> the bushel or under. That is as much to say, as
we that be husbandmen should not sell our wares, except it be for
nothing, or for so little we shall not be able to live thereof. Think
you that if the husbandman here did speak these words, that he did not
speak them reasonable?</p>

<p><i>Husbandman.</i> I thank you with all my heart; for you have spoken in the
matter more than I could do myself, and yet nothing but that is true. We
felt the harm, but we wist not what was the cause thereof; many of us
saw, 12 years ago, that our profits was but small by the ploughs; and
therefore divers of my neighbours that had, in times past, some two,
some three, some four ploughs of their own, have laid down, some of them
[part, and some of them all] their teams, and turned either part or all
their arable ground into pasture, and thereby have waxed very rich men.
And every day some of us encloseth a [plot] of his ground to pasture;
and were it not that our ground lieth in the common fields, intermingled
one with another, I think also our fields had been enclosed, of a common
agreement of all the township, long ere this time. And to say the truth,
I, that have enclosed little or nothing of my ground, could [never be
able] to make up my lord's rent were it not for a little breed of neat,
sheep, swine, geese, and hens that I do rear upon my ground; whereof,
because the price is somewhat round, I make more clear profit than I do
of all my corn; and yet I have but a bare living, by reason that many
things do belong to husbandry which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span> now be exceeding chargeable over
they were in times past.</p>

<p><i>Capper.</i> Though this reason of master doctor's here doth please you
well that be husbandmen, yet it pleaseth us that be artificers nothing
at all, which must buy both bread, corn and malt for our penny. And
whereas you, master doctor, say it were as good reason that the
husbandman would raise the price of his corn, and have as free vent of
the same over sea as we [do and have of our wares], I cannot greatly
deny that; but yet I say, that every man hath need of corn, and so they
have not of other wares so much.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Therefore the more necessary that corn is, the more be the men
to be cherished that reared it; for if they see there be not so much
profit in using the plough as they see in other feats, think you not
that they will leave that trade, and fall to the other that they see
more profitable? as ye may perceive by the doings of this honest man's
neighbours, which have turned their arable land to pasture, because they
see more profit by pasture than by tillage. Is it not an old saying in
[Latin], <i>honos alit artes</i>, that is to say, profit or advancement
nourisheth every faculty; which saying is so true, that it is allowed by
the common judgement of all men. We must understand also that all things
that should be done in a common wealth be not to be forced, or to be
constrained by the straight penalties of the law; but some so, and some
other by allurement and rewards rather. For what law can compel men to
be industrious in travail, and labour of their bodies, or studious to
learn any science or knowledge of the mind? to these things they may be
well provoked, encouraged, and allured, if they that be industrious and
painful be well rewarded for their pains, and be suffered to take gains
and wealth as reward of their labours. And so likewise [they] that be
learned, if they be advanced and honoured according to their forwardness
in learning, every man will then study either to be industrious in
bodily labour, or studious in things that pertain to knowledge. Take
this reward from them, and go about to compel them by laws thereto, what
man will plough or dig the ground, or exercise any manual occupation
wherein is any pain? Or who will adventure over seas for any
merchandise? or use any faculty wherein any peril or danger should be,
seeing his reward shall be no more than his that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span> sitteth still? But ye
will percase answer me, that all their rewards shall not be taken away,
but part of it. Yet then you must grant me, that as if all their rewards
were taken from them, all these faculties must needs decay; so if part
of that reward be minished, the use of those faculties shall minish
withall, after the rate; and so they shall be the less occupied, the
less they be rewarded and esteemed. But now to our purpose; I think it
more necessary to devise a mean how husbandry might be more occupied,
rather than less, which I cannot perceive how it may be brought to pass,
but as men do see the more gains therein, the gladder they will occupy
the feat. And this to be true [that] some things in a common wealth must
be forced with pains and some by rewards allured [may appear] by that
that the wise and politic senator Tully writeth, saying, that it was the
words of Solon, which was one of the seven men of Greece, and of those
seven the only man that made laws, that a common wealth was holden up by
things chiefly, that is, by reward and pain; of which words I gather
that men should be provoked to good deeds by rewards and price, and [to]
abstain from evil doings by pains. Trow you, if husbandmen be not better
cherished and provoked than they be to exercise to plough, but in
process of time so many ploughs will be laid down (as I fear me there be
already) that if an unfruitful year should happen amongst, us, as
commonly doth once in seven years, we should then not have only dearth,
but also such scarceness of corn, that we should be driven to seek it
from outward parts, and pay dear for it....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>f. 34b-f. 38.</i></p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> You have heard that by the free vent and sale of corn, the
husbandman's profit is advanced. Then it is showed how every man
naturally will follow that wherein he seeth most profit. Therefore men
will the gladder occupy husbandry. And the more do occupy husbandry, the
more plenty of corn must needs be; and the more plenty of corn there is,
thereof better cheap; and also the more will be spared over that that
shall suffice the realm; and then, that may be spared in a good year
shall bring us again other corn, or else the commodities of other
countries necessary for us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span> Then the more husbandry is occupied, the
more universal breed should be of all victuals, as of neat, sheep,
swine, geese, eggs, butter, and cheese, for all these are reared much of
corn.</p>

<p><i>Knight.</i> If men should sell, when a good reasonable year is, all that
is overplus when the realm is served, what should we do if a barren year
should happen, when no store of corn is left of the good year before?</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> First, you must consider that men be sure they will keep
enough to serve themselves within the realm, or they sell any forth of
the same; and having liberty to sell at their pleasure, doubt ye not,
but they had liefer sell their corn 2<i>d.</i> or 4<i>d.</i> better cheap within
the realm, than to be at charges with carrying, and peril of adventure,
in sending it over the sea, and sell it dearer (except it be for much
more gains). And thus men, being provoked with lucre, will keep the more
corn, looking for a dear year in the country, whereby must need be the
greater store. And though they did not so, but should sell over the sea
all that they might spare over that serveth the realm when the year is
plentiful, yet by reason that, through the means aforesaid, more ploughs
are set to work than would suffice the realm in a plentiful year, if a
scarce year should fall after, the corn of so many ploughs, as in a good
year would be more than enough, in [an unfruitful] year at the least
should be sufficient to serve the realm. And so should the realm be
served with enough of corn in a scarce year, and in a plenteous year no
more than enough, which might be sold over the sea for great treasure or
other commodities; where now, in a plentiful year, we seek to have as
much as may suffice the realm. Then if a scarce year should happen, we
must needs lack of our own to serve, and be driven to buy from beyond
the sea. And then, if they were as envious as we are, might they not
say, when we required any corn of them, that seeing they could get none
from us, when we had plenty, why should they let us have any corn when
we have scarcity? Surely common reason would that one region should help
another when it lacketh. And therefore God hath ordained that no country
should have all commodities; but that, that one lacketh, another
bringeth forth, and that, that one country lacketh this year, another
hath plenty thereof the same year, to the intent that one may know they
have need of another's help, and thereby love and society<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span> to grow
amongst all the more. But here we will do as though we had need of no
other country in the earth, but to live all of ourselves; and [as]
though we might make the market of all things as we list ourselves; for
though God is bountiful unto us and sendeth us many great commodities,
yet we could not live without the commodities of others. And, for an
ensample, of iron [and] salt, though we have competently thereof, yet we
have not the third part to suffice the realm; and that [can] in no wise
be spared if we will occupy husbandry. Then tar, resin, pitch, oil,
steel, we have none at all; as for wines, spices, linen cloth, silks,
and collars, though we might live so without them, yet far from any
civility should it be. As I deny not [but many things we might have here
sufficiently that we buy now beyond the seas, and] many things we might
spare wholly; whereof, if time shall serve, I will talk more hereafter.
But now to return to the first point that I spake of before, to be one
of the means to bring husbandry up, that is by abasing the estimation of
wool and fells; though I take not that way to be as good as the other,
for I do not allow that mean that may base any of our commodities except
it be for the enhancement of a better commodity, but if both commodities
may be enhanced together, as by the last device I think they might be, I
allow that way better; nevertheless whereas you, brother merchant,
showed before that either by restraining of wools or other commodities,
till they were equivalent within the realm after the rate of the corn,
or by enhancing the custom of wool and other the said commodities, were
brought like to the corn in proportion, the King's Highness' custom
should be minished, I think not so. For the one way, as much as he
should have for the more wool vented over, so much should he have for
the less wool at a greater custom vented over. And the other way is, as
much as his Grace should lose by his custom of wool, so much or more
should his Grace win by the custom of clothes made within the realm. But
one thing I do note by this latter device, that if they should take
place, we must do; that is, if we keep within us much of our
commodities, we must spare many other things that we have now from
beyond the seas; for we must always take heed that we buy no more of
strangers than we sell them [for so we should empoverish ourselves and
enrich them]. For he were no good husband that hath no other yearly
revenues but of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span> husbandry to live on, that will buy more in the market
than he selleth again. And that is a point we might save much by of our
treasure, in this realm, if we would. And I marvel no man taketh heed
unto it, what number first of trifles cometh hither from beyond the
seas, that we might either clean spare, or else make them within our own
realm, for the which we pay inestimable treasure every year, or else
exchange substantial wares and necessary for them, for the which we
might receive great treasure. Of the which sort I mean glasses, as well
looking as drinking, as to glass windows, dials, tables, cards, balls,
puppets, penhorns, inkhorns, toothpicks, gloves, knives, daggers,
pouches, brooches, agletes, buttons of silk and silver, earthen pots,
pins, points, hawk's bells, paper both white and brown, and a thousand
like things, that might either be clean spared, or else made within the
realm sufficient for us. And as for some things, they make it of our own
commodities and send it us again; whereby they set their people on work,
and do exhaust much treasure out of this realm. As of our wool they make
cloth, caps, and carses; of our fells they make Spanish skins, gloves,
girdles; of our tin, salts, spoons and dishes; of our broken linen cloth
and rags, paper both white and brown. What treasure, think you, goeth
out of this realm for every of these things? And then for all together
it exceedeth my estimation. There is no man that can be contented with
any other gloves than is made in France or in Spain; or carse, but it
must be of Flanders dye; nor cloth, but it must be of French dye or
fresadow; nor brooch nor aglet, but of Venice making or Milanese; nor
dagger, sword, nor girdle, or knife, but of Spanish making; no, not so
much as a spur, but it must be fetched at the milliner's hand. I have
seen within these twenty years, when there were not of these
haberdashers that sell French or Milan caps, glasses, as well looking as
drinking, yea, all manner vessels of the same stuff; painted cruses, gay
daggers, knives, swords, and girdles that is able to make any temperate
man to gaze on them, and to buy somewhat, though it serve to no purpose
necessary. What need they beyond the sea to travel to Peru or such far
country, or to try out the sands of the river Tagus in Spain [Pactolus]
in Asia and Ganges in India, to get amongst them small sparks of gold,
or to dig the bowels of the earth, for the mine of silver and gold, when
they can of unclean clay, not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span> far sought for, and of [pebble] stones
and fern roots make [good] gold and silver more than a great many of
gold mines would make. I think not so little as a hundred thousand pound
a year is fetched of our treasure for things of no value of themselves,
but only for the labours of the workers of the same, which are set on
work all of our charges. What grossness be we of, that see it and suffer
such a continual spoil to be made of our goods and treasure, by such
means and specially, that will suffer our own commodities to go, and set
strangers on work, and then to buy them again at their hands; as of our
wool they make and dye carses, fresadows, broadcloths, and caps beyond
the seas, and bring them hither to be sold again; wherein note, I pray
you, what they do make us pay at the end for our stuff again, for the
stranger custom, for the workmanship, and colours, and lastly for the
second custom in the return of the wares into the realm again; whereas,
with working the same within our realm, our own men should be set on
work at the charges of strangers; the custom should be borne all by
strangers to the king, and the clear gains to remain within the
realm....</p>

<p><i>f. 53b-f. 55.</i></p>

<p>And now, because we are entered into communication of artificers, I will
make this division of them. Some of them do but bring money out of the
country; some other, that which they do get, they spend again in the
country; and the third sort of artificers be they that do bring treasure
into the country. Of the first, I reckon all mercers, grocers, vintners,
haberdashers, milliners, and such as do sell wares growing beyond the
seas, and do fetch out our treasure of the same. Which kind of
artificers, as I reckon them tolerable, and yet are not so necessary in
a commonwealth but they might be best spared of all other; yet if we had
not other artificers, to bring in as much treasure as they bring forth,
we should be great losers by them. Of the second sort be these:
shoemakers, tailors, carpenters, masons, tilers, butchers, brewers,
bakers, victuallers of all sorts, which like as they get their living in
the country, so they spend it; but they bring in no treasure unto us.
Therefore we must [cherish] well the third sort; and these be clothiers,
tanners, cappers, and worsted makers only that I know, [which] by their
misteries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span> and faculties, do bring in any treasure. As for our wool,
fells, tin, lead, butter and cheese, these be the commodities that the
ground bears, requiring the industry of a few persons; and if we should
only trust to such, and devise nothing else to occupy ourselves, a few
persons would serve us for the rearing of such things, and few also [it
would] find; and so should the realm be like a [grange], better
furnished with beasts than with men; whereby it might be subject to the
spoil of other nations about. Which is the more to be feared and
eschewed, because the country of his own kind is apt to bring forth such
things, as is said before, for the breed of cattle, than for such things
as [be] for the nourishment of men, if Pomponius Mela be to be believed,
which describing the island, saith thus: <i>plana, ingens, fecunda, verum
iis que pecora quam homines benignius alunt</i>. That is to say, it is
plain, large and plentiful, but of those things that nourisheth beasts
more kindly than men. So many forests, chases, parks, marshes and waste
grounds, that be more here than most commonly elsewhere, declare the
same not to be all in vain that he affirms; that hath not so much arable
ground, vines, olives, fruits, and such as be most necessary for the
food of men. And as they require many hands in the culture, so they find
most persons food; as France, Spain and divers other countries have.
Therefore as much ground, as here is apt for those things, would be
[turned] (as much as may be) to such uses as may find most persons. And
over that, towns and cities would be replenished with all kinds of
artificers; not only clothiers which as yet were our natural occupation,
but with cappers, glovers, paper makers, glasiers, pointers, goldsmiths,
blacksmiths of all sorts, coverlet makers, needle makers, pinners and
such other; so as we should not only have enough of such things to serve
our realm, and save an infinite treasure that goeth now over for so many
of the same, but also might spare of such things ready wrought to be
sold over, whereby we should fetch again other necessary commodities and
treasures. And thus should be both replenished the realm of people able
to defend it, and also win much treasure to the same. Such occupations
alone do enrich divers countries, that be else barren of themselves; and
what riches they bring to the country where they be well used, the
country of Flanders and Germany do well declare; where, through such
occupations, it hath so many and wealthy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span> cities, that were incredible
in so little ground to be. Wherefore in my mind they are far wide of
right consideration, that would have none or less clothing within the
realm, because it is sometimes occasion of business or tumults, for lack
of vent. There is nothing every way so commodious or necessary for men's
use, but it is sometime by ill handling occasion of displeasure; no, not
fire and water, that be so necessary as nothing can be more.</p>


<p>4. <span class="smcap"><a name="Sir_Thomas_Gresham_on_the_Fall_of_the_Exchanges" id="Sir_Thomas_Gresham_on_the_Fall_of_the_Exchanges"></a>Sir Thomas Gresham on the Fall of the Exchanges</span> [<i>Burgon's
Life and Times of Sir Thomas Gresham, Vol. I, Appendix No. XXI, pages
483-486</i>]. 1558.</p>

<p>To the Queen's most excellent Majesty.</p>

<p>It may please your Majesty to understand, that the first occasion of the
fall of the exchange did grow by the King's Majesty, your late father,
in abasing his coin from vi ounces fine to iii ounces fine. Whereupon
the exchange fell from xxvi<i>s.</i> viii<i>d.</i> to xiii<i>s.</i> iv<i>d.</i> which was
the occasion that all your fine gold was conveyed out of this your
realm.</p>

<p>Secondly, by the reason of his wars, the King's Majesty fell into great
debt in Flanders. And for the payment thereof they had no other device
but pay it by exchange, and to carry over his fine gold for the payment
of the same.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the great freedom of the Steelyard and granting of licence for
the carrying of your wool and other commodities out of your realm, which
is now one of the chief points that your Majesty hath to foresee in this
your common weal; that you never restore the steads called the Steelyard
again to their privilege, which hath been the chief point of the undoing
of this your realm, and the merchants of the same.</p>

<p>Now, for redress of these things, in an. xvcli [1551] the King's
Majesty, your late brother, called me to be his agent, and reposed a
more trust in me, as well for the payment of his debts beyond the seas,
as for the raising of the exchange, being then at xv<i>s.</i> and xvi<i>s.</i> the
pound; and your money current, as it is at this present, being not in
value x<i>s.</i> First, I practised with the King and my lord of
Northumberland to overthrow the Steelyard, or else it could not be
brought to pass, for that they would keep down the exchange by this
consideration; whereas your own merchants payeth outwards xiv<i>d.</i> upon
a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span> cloth custom, they pay but ix<i>d.</i>; and likewise, for all such wares
as was brought into your realm, your own mere merchants payeth xii<i>d.</i>
upon the pound, the Steelyard paid but iii<i>d.</i> upon the pound, which is
v<i>s.</i> difference upon the hundredth: and as they were men that ran all
upon the exchange for the buying of their commodities, what did they
pass to give a lower price than your own merchants, when they got v<i>l.</i>
in the hundred by your custom? Which in process of time would have
undone your whole realm, and your merchants of the same.</p>

<p>Secondly, I practised with the King's Majesty, your brother, to come in
credit with his own mere merchants: and when time served, I practised
with them at a set shipping, the exchange being still at xvi<i>s.</i>, that
every man should pay the King xv<i>s.</i> upon a cloth in Antwerp, to pay at
double usage xx<i>s.</i> in London; which the King's Majesty paid them
royally, which did amount to the sum of lxm<i>l.</i> And so, vi months after,
I practised the like upon their commodities for the sum of lxxm<i>l.</i>
[&pound;70,000] to pay for every pound sterling xxii<i>s.</i>: so by this means, I
made plenty of money, and scarcity, and brought into the King's hands,
which raised, the exchange to xxiii<i>s.</i> iv<i>d.</i> And by this means I did
not only bring the King's Majesty, your brother, out of debt, whereby I
saved him vi or vii<i>s.</i> upon the pound, but saved his treasure within
the realm, as therein Mr. Secretary Cecil was most privy unto.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I did likewise cause all foreign coins to be unvalued, whereby
it might be brought into the mint to his Majesty's most fordle<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>; at
which time the King your brother died, and for my reward of service, the
Bishop of Winchester sought to undo me, and whatsoever I said in these
matters I should not be credited: and against all wisdom, the said
Bishop went and valued the French crown at vi<i>s.</i> iv<i>d.</i>, and the
pistole at vi<i>s.</i> ii<i>d.</i>, and the silver royal at vi<i>d.</i> <i>ob.</i>
Whereupon, immediately, the exchange fell to xx<i>s.</i> vi<i>d.</i> and xxi<i>s.</i>,
and there hath kept ever since. And so consequently after this rate and
manner, I brought the Queen's Majesty, your sister, out of debt of the
sum of ccccxxxvm<i>l.</i> [&pound;435,000].</p>

<p>Fourthly, by this it may plainly appear to your Highness, as the
exchange is the thing that eats out all princes, to the whole
destruction of their common weal, if it be not substantially looked
unto, so likewise the exchange is the chief and richest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span> thing only
above all other, to restore your Majesty and your realm to fine gold and
silver, and is the mean that makes all foreign commodities and your own
commodities with all kind of victuals good cheap, and likewise keeps
your fine gold and silver within your realm. As, for example to your
Highness, the exchange being at this present at xxii<i>s.</i>, all merchants
seek to bring into your realm fine gold and silver; for if he should
deliver it by exchange, he disburses xxii<i>s.</i> Flemish to have xx<i>s.</i>
sterling: and to bring it in gold and silver he shall make thereof
xxi<i>s.</i> iv<i>d.</i>&mdash;whereby he saves viii<i>d.</i> in the pound: which profit, if
the exchange should keep but after this rate of xxii<i>s.</i> in few years
you should have a wealthy realm, for here the treasure should continue
for ever; for that all men should find more profit by v<i>l</i> in the
hundred to deliver it per exchange, than to carry it over in money. So
consequently the higher the exchange riseth, the more shall your Majesty
and your realm and common weal flourish, which thing is only kept up by
art and God's providence; for the coin of this your realm doth not
correspond in fineness not x<i>s.</i> the pound.</p>

<p>Finally, and it please your majesty to restore this your realm into such
state, as heretofore it hath been; first, your Highness hath no other
ways, but when time and opportunity serveth, to bring your base money
into fine of xi ounces fine, and so gold after the rate.</p>

<p>Secondly, not to restore the Steelyard to their usurped privileges.</p>

<p>Thirdly, to grant as few licences as you can.</p>

<p>Fourthly, to come in as small debt as you can beyond seas.</p>

<p>Fifthly, to keep up your credit, and specially with your own merchants,
for it is they must stand by you at all events in your necessity. And
thus I shall most humbly beseech your Majesty to accept this my [poor
writing in good] part; wherein I shall from time to time, as opportunity
doth serve, put your Highness in remembrance, according to the trust
your Majesty hath reposed in me; beseeching the Lord to give me the
grace and fortune that my service may always be acceptable to your
Highness; as knoweth our Lord, whom preserve your noble Majesty in
health, and long to reign over us with increase of honour.</p>

<p>By your Majesty's most humble and faithful obedient subject,</p>

<p>Where the Queen's Majesty is moved, that for the staying of the
transportation of gold she will be pleased either to call in all gold by
proclamation and then to coin it anew again with more alloy, or else
that her Majesty should call in no gold, but coin new and utter them at
higher rate than now, it seemeth the matters intend, that it is
transported for the richness only, and, being either based by alloy or
dearly priced, no more would be transported.</p>

<p>But if all the true causes of this late transportation be considered,
that will not be sufficient to stay gold within.</p>

<p>The true causes, that it is transported, be these with others:</p>

<p>1. Some is carried into the Low Countries, because the exchange hath
been high and the gold of greater prices there than here.</p>

<p>2. These dear years much hath been carried out to buy corn with, wherein
somewhat endeavour hath been, because the return paid no custom.</p>

<p>3. Very much hath been transported to provide foreign commodities,
because this realm spendeth more of them, than the same commodities
transported amount unto, as it is supposed and as may be perceived by
the wines, silks, lawns, gold-lace, silver-lace and such like here
spent.</p>

<p>4. Much is conveyed by strangers, that bring in their country
commodities and will not employ the price in English commodities,
because their customs be great.</p>

<p>5. The like is sometimes done by English merchants for the paying of
debts or providing of foreign commodities, for the saving of custom
outward being also great.</p>

<p>6. Much bullion hath been transported, because the merchants and
goldsmiths could not of long time have it coined and delivered in due
time out of the mint.</p>

<p>7. Some by captains, soldiers and others, that might not be searched.</p>

<p>8. Some by the help of the mintmen in thirty-shilling-pieces upon
pretence to make great gain thereof to her Majesty.</p>

<p>The second cause will now cease of itself; the fourth, fifth, sixth and
eighth may be removed by good orders to be taken;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span> the seventh by peace
amongst princes; the first will never be taken away further than shall
please the bankers and rich merchants of the Low Countries, who joining
with the rich Flemings dwelling will be able with their money and
cunning to make the exchange to rise and fall, as they shall think good
for their gain or our loss. And the governors there, finding by their
mint-masters and merchants the alteration of the English standards and
values of gold, being more vigilant, provident and skilful in such
matters than the English, will at their pleasures cry up and down the
currency of English coin, be it never so base, at such times and in such
manner as [the]y will, draw it from home to their ... lnes and melt it
or return it back at their pleasures for their own gain and our loss,
unless they will agree and take order, that it shall be always current
there at the same value that it is here, without alteration.</p>

<p>But the third <i>causa causarum</i> being taken away, which is to be wished
for, although not to be hoped for in haste, all the rest and all other
like causes of transportation must need cease withall or at the least do
little hurt; for if England would spend less of foreign commodities than
the home commodities will pay for, then the remain must of necessity be
returned of silver or gold; but if otherwise, then it will fare in
England in short time as it doth with a man of great yearly living, that
spendeth more yearly than his own revenue, and spendeth of the stock
besides.</p>

<p>And so it is concluded, that for these reasons neither the baseing of
the standards nor the raising of the values of the coin of gold is like
to stay it from transportation.</p>

Gresham and Other Royal Commissioners</span> [<i>Ms. of Lord Calthorpe, Vol.

<p>Forasmuch as your worships have required, that we, the merchants
Italians, should show present your worships with more brevity, than we
have done afore, in what points doth grieve us the new imposition and
order, that hath been set upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span> the exchange, although it is not easily
utter it in few words, nevertheless we have set it forth as briefly as
we can.</p>

<p>Therefore it may please your worships to understand, that the chiefest
living and maintenance that we have is upon the commissions that are
sent unto us of our friends from beyond the seas to sell foreign wares
here in London and buy English wares for to send over.</p>

<p>The trade of the foreign wares for England will much decay because of
the imposition and difficulty upon the exchange; for such our friends,
that did send such commodities as alum, woad, canvas, silks, wines and
other necessary things for the intent to reiterate shortly after the
sending hither such commodities, so soon as they knew they were here
arrived, did use to take up money by exchange for London; and if the
said wares were not sold or money not due, they gave here commission to
their factors to take it up by rechange again; and so in time of an
usage or double usage of Antwerp, an usage or a fair at Lyons, this
matter might be well compassed without any great loss, and by this mean
they might help themselves with their money of their wares a great while
before that it were money in deed; but now that they shall know, that
the exchange will give them such loss by the payment of this fee besides
the ordinary interest that is used to come upon the exchange, they shall
not be able to continue this trade nor to reiterate so often the same.
Therefore there shall ensue a great diminishing of the Queen's custom
inwards, and that the English people shall pay the dearer for the
necessary foreign commodities, and we particularly shall remain
destitute of these commissions and factories.</p>

<p>We say likewise of the trade of others our commissioners, that did use
to send for English commodities as cloths and others being not forbidden
and inward, they send nothing or very little; for those, that ought here
to buy for themselves, might in two manners furnish the money, the one
causing money to be remitted unto them from beyond the seas, and the
other in taking money here in London by exchange. Touching the first
manner they shall lack much of that help; for money shall not be
remitted unto them, for because in foreign places there shall be found
no man that will take up money by exchange for London, knowing that it
shall be more damageable unto them than other places as much as this fee
doth import,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span> which will always fall upon the debtor, and he shall
scarcely find money here in London to take up by exchange; so little
will be exchange that hereafter will be made, therefore our commission
outward will fail unto us, as we have said above of these inward, and
the Queen's customs outwards also will much decay, and the English
people, that did utter at good prices the commodities and handicrafts,
shall not be able to do it as afore they were, they shall suffer much
damage and discommodity. Besides this the free exchange hath been an
instrument whereby the merchants might pay honourably their debts at
their day; for if one ought, for a manner of an example, this day a sum
of money, it should be a dishonour unto him to desire his creditors to
tarry a seven night, a fortnight or 20 days, until he should retain
money for debts due unto him. But to pay his said debt, he might
presently take up money by exchange to Lyons, Antwerp and then, after he
had received his money, he might remit there for the same time that he
took it up, and so with little loss compass his business. But now in
such case considering that he shall be forced to pay two times this
imposition one in the taking and the other in the delivering so shortly
after, the interest of few days will cost him too much; therefore he
shall be fain to restrain his trade and shall not be able to accept his
friends' debts and changes he did before.</p>

<p>Likewise those of us shall find too much charges, that made double
exchanges for service of the English merchants, as for example they took
money of your vintners for Bordeaux, and to the intent that the said
money might be ready there, they did exchange it for Lyons or other
places being content of any small profit; now that they must pay two
times this imposition and that the ordinary brokerage, that often times
they did save, they now shall not save, they shall need to make their
reckoning and ask greater price of the vintners, the which peradventure
will find it so heavy beside his part of the fee which he must pay, that
he might take an evil occasion to send over the money.</p>

<p>We made also oftentimes amongst us double exchanges without any broker,
which was, for a manner of example, that one of us had money in Venice
and would bring into this realm French wares, and another hath money in
Lyons and would bring wares out of Italy, and so they did agree together
to give one to another mutual letters of exchange the one for Lyons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span> and
the other for Venice; and whereas such double exchange of the value of
100<i>li.</i> had no charge at all, now it shall have charge 35<i>s.</i>, for the
fee shall be paid for every one of the 2 bills of exchange, which is
25<i>s.</i> and 10<i>s.</i> brokerage, that now is not to be escaped, maketh up
the 35<i>s.</i>, so that we shall be fain utterly to leave of these double
exchanges, that we made as well for the commodity of the merchants of
your nation as of ourselves to the intent still to serve to the ease and
trade of merchandise.</p>

<p>But<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> the order yet is of more trouble and impediment, than the very
imposition; for though the fee were in a manner but a penny in every
hundredth pound, it were needful to find a means that the Queen's
Majesty should not be defrauded of the same, the which we cannot invent
or imagine, without that register shall be kept of all our doings and
that our books shall be seen and our letters opened, the which thing
will be an extreme prejudice unto our occupations, and we would have
taken pain more at large to express the same, if that your worships had
not the experience and knowledge better than us of this matter.</p>

<p>Touching the standard of the English money, that you complain of is kept
low by reason of the free exchange, we can say nothing but that our
exchanges are made with a mutual consent between merchant and merchant,
and that the abundance of the deliverers or of the takers make the
exchange rise or fall; and this occasion doth counterpoise this place of
London with the others; for if you will compel a needful person to take
up for exchange for Antwerp at 26<i>s.</i> Flemish for every pound sterling,
when the exchange is there at 24<i>s.</i>, he shall leave off to take it, but
will cause money to be remitted to him from thence according to the
course of the exchange there.</p>

<p>But some do complain of some strangers, that bring into England
merchandises for more value than that they send out. We say, that the
cause of this is the inequalities of the customs outwards; for a
stranger cannot send into Flanders or into France a piece of cloth or
kersey, except it should stand him dearer than he might have them there
in those places at an Englishman's hands. Besides that it is to be
considered, that the most part of commodities of this realm,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span> that in
times before might be transported out, now they be utterly forbidden as
well corn, leather, tallow, or else charged with great licence as
undressed cloths and others, so that it is not possible for strangers to
meddle there withall; nevertheless we do deny, that the overplus of the
amounting of the strange wares should be sent over by us in ready money,
but we deliver it by exchange unto your English merchants, that may
better traffic outwardly, and if we do at lower price than the value of
the standard, we are very sorry and we would very gladly it were
otherwise.</p>

<p>That be the damages difficulties and inconveniences, that by this order
shall happen, that is to say, for our part the whole destitution of all
our friends' commission, whereupon was grounded our living and
maintenance; damage unto Queen's Majesty for the diminishing of her
customs for greater sum than the importance of the rent of this fee,
though that exchanges should be in such frequency and number as they
have been heretofore; the which thing cannot be, for very few exchange
will be made; damage also to the common weal, for they shall pay dear
for foreign wares for the scarcity that shall be here of the same, and
they shall not so well sell the commodities of the realm, as they have
done afore; and finally a dangerous occasion may be presented to some to
carry away the money out of the realm, the which thing the free exchange
doth avoid, and for this intent it is to be thought that it was
instituted.</p>

<p>Therefore we, considering that among all restraints, troubles or
impediments, that ever was set against the trade of merchants in any
place, this is the troublesomest, we beseech your worships to examine it
and to report to her Majesty and to her honourable council upon this
matter even as God Almighty shall inspire you for the common profit and
wealth of this realm.</p>

Part I, pp. 428-429</i>], 1562.</p>

<p>Whereas heretofore the artificers of this realm of England (as well
within the city of London as within other cities, towns and boroughs of
the same realm) that is to wit, girdlers, cutlers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span> saddlers, glovers,
point-makers, and such like handicraftsmen, have been in the said
faculties greatly wrought, and greatly set on work, as well for the
sustentation of themselves, their wives and families, as for a good
education of a great part of the youth of this realm in good art and
laudable exercise, besides the manifold benefits, that by means or by
reason of their knowledges, inventions, and continual travel, daily and
universally came to the whole estate of the commonwealth of this said
realm:</p>

<p>II. Yet notwithstanding so now it is, that by reason of the abundance of
foreign wares brought into this realm from the parts of beyond the seas,
the said artificers are not only less occupied, and thereby utterly
impoverished, the youth not trained in the said sciences and exercises,
and thereby the said faculties, and the exquisite knowledges thereof,
like in short time within this realm to decay; but also divers cities
and towns within this realm of England much thereby impaired, the whole
realm greatly endamaged, and other countries notably enriched, and the
people thereof well set on work, to their commodities and livings, in
the arts and sciences aforesaid, and to the great discouragement of
skilful workmen of this realm, being in very deed nothing inferior to
any stranger in the faculties aforesaid.</p>

<p>III. For reformation whereof, be it enacted by our sovereign lady the
Queen's Highness, and by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the
Commons of this present parliament assembled and by the authority of the
same, that no person or persons whatsoever, from or after the feast of
the Nativity of St. John Baptist now next ensuing, shall bring or cause

please the Queen's most excellent Majesty, at the most humble suit of
her said subjects, that it be enacted, and be it enacted by the

of this statute, twelve pence, and of every quarter of any other grain,
eight pence, and of every quarter of wheat that shall be by any special
licence hereafter to be granted transported out of the realm, and not by

<p>11. <span class="smcap"><a name="Instructions_for_an_English_Factor_in_Turkey" id="Instructions_for_an_English_Factor_in_Turkey"></a>Instructions for an English Factor in Turkey</span> [<i>Hakluyt. The
Principal Voyages of the English Nation</i>], 1582.</p>

<p>... And for that of many things that tend to the common benefit of the
State, some tend more and some less, I find that no one thing, after one
another, is greater than clothing, and the things incident to the same.
And understanding that you are of right good capacity, and become a
factor at Constantinople, and in other parts of Turkey, I find no man
fitter of all the English factors there than you. And therefore I am so
bold to put you in mind and to tell you wherein with some endeavour you
may chance to do your country much good, and give an infinite sort of
the poor people occasion to pray for you here throughout the realm. This
that I mean is in matter of cloth, etc.</p>

<p>1. First, you cannot deny but that this realm yieldeth the most fine
wool, the most soft, the most strong wool, the most durable in cloth,
and most apt of nature of all others to receive dye, and that no island
or any one kingdom so small doth yield so great abundance of the
same....</p>

<p>2. There is no commodity of this realm that may set so many poor
subjects on work, as this doth, that doth bring in so much treasure, and
so much enrich the merchant, and so much employ the navy of this realm,
as this commodity of our wool doth.</p>

<p>Ample and full vent of this noble and rich commodity is it that the
commonweal of this realm doth require.</p>

<p>Spain now aboundeth with wool, and the same are clothed. Turkey hath
wools, and so have divers provinces of Christendom and of heatheners,
and cloth is made of the same in divers places.</p>

<p>1. But if England have the most fine and the most excellent wools of the
world in all respects (as it cannot be denied but it hath). 2. If there
may be added to the same excellent artificial, and true making, and
excellent dyeing. 3. Then no doubt but that we shall have vent for our
cloths, though the rest of the world did abound much more with wool than
it doth....</p>

<p>But if foreign nations turn their wools, inferior to ours, into truer
and more excellent made cloth, and shall dye the same in truer, surer,
and more excellent and more delectable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span> colours, then shall they sell
and make ample vent of their cloths, when the English cloth of better
wool shall rest unsold, to the spoil of the merchant, of the clothier,
and of the breeder of the wool, and to the turning to bag and wallet of
the infinite number of the poor people employed in clothing in several
degrees of labour here in England.</p>

<p>Which things weighed, I am to tell you what things I wish you in this
realm, and after in Turkey, to endeavour from time to time, as your
leisure may permit the same.</p>

<p>Before you out of the realm, that you learn:</p>

<p>1. To know wool, all kinds of cloth made in this realm, and all other
employments of wool, home or foreign.... All the deceits in clothmaking
... The faults in weaving. The faults in walking, rowing, burling, and
in racking the cloth above measure upon the tenters....</p>

<p>2. Then to learn of the dyers to discern all kinds of colours, as which
be good and sure, and which will not hold; which be fair, and which
not....</p>

<p>3. Then to take the names of all the materials and substances used in
this city or in the realm in dyeing of cloth or silk....</p>

<p>4. These things superficially learned in the realm before you go, you
are fitter in foreign parts to serve your country....</p>

<p>What you shall do in Turkey, besides the business of your factorship.</p>

<p>1. Forasmuch as it is reported that the woollen cloths dyed in Turkey be
most excellently dyed, you shall send home unto this realm certain ...
pieces of shred, to be brought to the Dyers' Hall, there to be shewed,
partly to remove out of their heads the too great opinion they have
conceived of their own cunning, and partly to move them for shame to
endeavour to learn more knowledge, to the honour of their country of
England and to the universal benefit of the realm.</p>

<p>2. You shall devise to amend the dyeing of England, by carrying hence an
apt young man brought up in the art, or by bringing one or other from
thence of skill, or rather to devise to bring one for silks, and another
for wool and for woollen cloth....</p>

<p>3. Then to learn to know all the materials and substances that the Turks
use in dyeing, be they of herbs, simple or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span> compound, be they plants,
barks, wood, berries, seeds, grains, or mineral matter....</p>

<p>5. And in any wise, if anile that coloureth blue be a natural commodity
of those parts, and if it be compounded of an herb, to send the same
into this realm by seed, or by root in barrel of earth, with all the
whole order of sowing, setting, planting, replanting, and with the
compounding of the same, that it may become a natural commodity in this
realm, as woad is, to this end, that the high price of foreign woad
(which devoureth yearly great treasure) may be brought down....</p>

<p>8. The wools being natural, and excellent colours for dyeing by this
means here also natural, in all the art of clothing then we want but one
only special thing. For in this so temperate a climate our people may
labour the year throughout ... and the people of this realm by the great
and blessed abundance of victual are cheaply fed, and therefore may
afford their labour cheap. And where the clothiers in Flanders, by the
flatness of their rivers, cannot make water-mills for their cloths, but
are forced to dress and thicken all their cloths by the foot and by the
labour of men, whereby their cloths are raised to an higher price, we in
England have in all shires store of mills upon falling rivers.... Then
we have also, for scouring our cloths, earths and clays.... Then also
have we some reasonable store of alum and copperas here, made for
dyeing.... Then we have many good waters apt for dyeing, and people to
spin and to do the rest of all the labours we want not. So as there
wanteth, if colours might be brought in and made natural, but only oil;
the want whereof if any man could devise to supply at the full with
anything that might become natural in this realm, he, whatsoever he were
that could bring it about, might deserve immortal fame in this our
commonwealth....</p>

<p>10. And if you shall find that they make any cloth of any kind not made
in this realm, that is there of great use, then to bring of the same
into this realm some "mowsters,"<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> that our people may fall into the
trade, and prepare the same for Turkey. For the more kinds of cloth we
can devise to make, the more ample vent of our commodity we shall have,
and the more sale of the labour of our poor subjects that else for lack
of labour become idle and burdenous to the commonweal, and hurtful to
many. And in England we are in our clothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span> trade to frame ourselves
according to the desires of foreign nations, be it that they desire
thick or thin, broad or narrow, long or short, white or black.</p>

<p>11. But with this proviso always, that our cloth pass out with as much
labour of our people as may be, wherein great consideration ought to be
had. For (if vent might so admit), as it were the greatest madness in
the world for us to vent our wool not clothed, so were it madness to
vent our wool in part or on the whole turned into broad cloth, if we
might vent the same in kersies; for there is a great difference to our
people between the clothing of a sack of wool in the one and the like
sack of wool in the other, of which I wish the merchant of England to
have a great care as he may for the universal benefit of the poor; and
the turning of a sack of wool into bonnets is better than both, etc. And
also not to carry out of the realm any cloth white, but dyed, if it may
be, that the subjects of this realm may take as much benefit as is
possible, and rather to seek the vent of the cloths dyed with the
natural colours of England than such as be dyed with foreign colours.</p>

<p>Thus giving you occasion, by way of a little remembrance, to have desire
to do your country good, you shall, if you have any inclination to such
good, do more good to the poor ready to starve for relief than ever any
subject did in this realm by building of almshouses, and by giving of
lands and goods to the relief of the poor. Thus may you help to drive
idleness, the mother of most mischief, out of the realm, and win you
perpetual fame, and the prayer of the poor, which is more worth than all
the gold of Peru and of all the West Indies.</p>

Discoveries and Possession Taken in the Right of the Crown of England of

Principal Voyages of the English Nation</i>], 1583.</p>

<p>... The fourth chapter sheweth how that the trade, traffic, and planting
in these countries is likely to prove very profitable to the whole realm
in general.</p>

<p>Now to show how the same is likely to prove very profitable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span> and
beneficial generally to the whole realm. It is very certain that the
greatest jewel of this realm, and the chiefest strength and force of the
same, for defence or offence in martial matter and manner, is the
multitude of ships, masters, and mariners ready to assist the most
stately and royal navy of her Majesty, which by reason of this voyage
shall have both increase and maintenance. And it is well known that in
sundry places of this realm ships have been built and set forth of late
days for the trade of fishing only; yet, notwithstanding, the fish which
is taken and brought into England by the English navy of fishermen will
not suffice for the expense of this realm four months, if there were
none else brought of strangers. And the chiefest cause why our English
men do not go so far westerly as the especial fishing places do lie,
both for plenty and greatness of fish, is for that they have no succour
and known safe harbour in those parts. But if our nation were once
planted there or thereabouts, whereas they now fish but for two months
in the year, they might then fish for so long as pleased themselves ...
which being brought to pass shall increase the number of our ships and
mariners.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is well known that all savages ... will take marvellous
delight in any garment, be it never so simple, as a shirt, a blue,
yellow, red, or green cotton cassock, a cap, or such like, and will take
incredible pains for such a trifle, ... which being so, what vent for
our English cloths will thereby ensue, and how great benefit to all such
persons and artificers, whose names are quoted in the margin, I leave to
such as are discreet....</p>

<p>To what end need I endeavour myself by arguments to prove that by this
voyage our navy and navigation shall be enlarged, when as there needeth
none other reason than the manifest and late example of the near
neighbours to this realm, the Kings of Spain and Portugal, who, since
the first discovery of the Indies, have not only mightily enlarged their
dominions, greatly enriched themselves and their subjects, but have
also, by just account, trebled the number of their ships, masters and
mariners, a matter of no small moment and importance?</p>

<p>Besides this, it will prove a general benefit unto our country, that,
through this occasion, not only a great number of men which do now live
idly at home, and are burdenous, chargeable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span> and unprofitable to this
realm, shall hereby be set on work, but also children of twelve or
fourteen years of age, or under, may be kept from idleness, in making of
a thousand kinds of trifling things, which will be good merchandise for
that country. And, moreover, our idle women (which the realm may well
spare) shall also be employed on plucking, drying, and sorting of
feathers, in pulling, beating, and working of hemp, and in gathering of
cotton, and divers things right necessary for dyeing. All which things
are to be found in those countries most plentifully. And the men may
employ themselves in dragging for pearl, working for mines, and in
matters of husbandry, and likewise in hunting the whale for trane, and
making casks to put the same in, besides in fishing for cod, salmon and
herring, drying, salting and barrelling the same, and felling of trees,
hewing and sawing of them, and such like work, meet for those persons
that are no men of art or science.</p>

<p>Many other things may be found to the great relief and good employment
of no small number of the natural subjects of this realm, which do now
live here idly, to the common annoy of the whole State. Neither may I
here omit the great hope and likelihood of a passage beyond the Grand
Bay into the South Seas, confirmed by sundry authors to be found leading
to Cataia, the Moluccas and Spiceries, whereby may ensue as general a
benefit to the realm, or greater than yet hath been spoken of, without
either such charges or other inconveniences, as, by the tedious tract of
time and peril, which the ordinary passage to those parts at this day
doth minister....</p>

<p>I must now, according to my promise, show forth some probable reasons
that the adventurers in this journey are to take particular profit by
the same. It is, therefore, convenient that I do divide the adventurers
into two sorts, the noblemen and gentlemen by themselves, and the
merchants by themselves. For, as I do hear, it is meant that there shall
be one society of the noblemen and gentlemen, and another society of the
merchants; and yet not so divided, but that each society may freely and
frankly trade and traffic one with the other.</p>

<p>And first to bend my speech to the noblemen and gentlemen, who do
chiefly seek a temperate climate, wholesome air, fertile soil, and a
strong place by nature whereupon they may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span> fortify, and there either
plant themselves or such other persons as they shall think good to send
to be lords of that place and country:&mdash;To them I say that all these
things are very easy to be found within the degrees of 30 and 60
aforesaid, either by south or north, both in the continent and in
islands thereunto adjoining, at their choice ... and in the whole tract
of that land, by the description of as many as have been there, great
plenty of mineral matter of all sorts, and in very many places both
stones of price, pearl and chrystal, and great store of beasts, birds,
and fowls, both for pleasure and necessary use of man are to be
found....</p>

<p>And now for the better contemplation and satisfaction of such
worshipful, honest-minded and well-disposed merchants as have a desire
to the furtherance of every good and commendable action, I will first
say unto them, as I have done before to the noblemen and gentlemen, that
within the degrees aforesaid is doubtless to be found the most wholesome
and best temperature of air, fertility of soil, and every other
commodity or merchandise, for the which, with no small peril, we do
travel into Barbary, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Muscovy and
Eastland, and yet, to the end my argument shall not altogether stand
upon likelihoods and presumptions, I say that such persons as have
discovered and travelled those parts do testify that they have found in
those countries all these things following, namely:&mdash;[a list of beasts,
birds, fishes, trees, minerals, etc.] ...</p>

<p>Now for the trial hereof, considering that in the articles of the
society of the adventurers in this voyage there is provision made that
no adventurer shall be bound to any further charge than his first
adventure, and notwithstanding keep still to himself, his children, his
apprentices and servants, his and their freedom for trade and traffic,
which is a privilege that adventurers in other voyages have not; and in
the said articles it is likewise provided that none other than such as
have adventured in the first voyage, or shall become adventurers in this
supply, at any time hereafter are to be admitted in the said society,
but as redemptionaries, which will be very chargeable; therefore,
generally, I say unto all such, according to the old proverb. "Nothing
venture, nothing have" ...</p>

<p>The sixth chapter sheweth that the traffic and planting in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span> those
countries shall be unto the savages themselves very beneficial and
gainful....</p>

<p>... First and chiefly, in respect of the most happy and gladsome tidings
of the most glorious gospel of our Saviour Jesus Christ, whereby they
may be brought from falsehood to truth, from darkness to light, from the
highway of death to the path of life, from superstitious idolatry to
sincere Christianity, from the devil to Christ, from hell to heaven. And
if in respect of all the commodities they can yield us (were they many
more) that they should but receive but this only benefit of
Christianity, they were more than fully recompensed.</p>

<p>But hereunto it may be objected that the Gospel must be freely preached,
for such was the example of the apostles.... Yet for answer we may say
with St. Paul: If we have sown unto you heavenly things, do you think it
much that we should reap your carnal things? And withal, The workman is
worthy of his hire. These heavenly tidings which those labourers our
countrymen (as messengers of God's great goodness and mercy) will
voluntarily present unto them, do far exceed their earthly riches....</p>

Trade</span> [<i>Sir H. Nicholas, Memoirs of Sir Christopher Hatton, pp.
470-2</i>], 1587.</p>

<p class='center'><span class="smcap">To the Lord Chancellor.</span></p>

<p>My Lord,</p>

<p>I am sorry that my pains are such as I cannot attend on you to-day in
the Star Chamber, having yesterday, by more zeal of service in the
Exchequer Chamber than of regard to my harms, so weakened and pained my
leg, as I cannot stir it out of my bed; but this my declaration of my
state is to no purpose to occupy your Lordship withal. This great matter
of the lack of vent, not only of clothes, which presently is the
greatest, but of all other English commodities which are restrained from
Spain, Portugal, Barbary, France, Flanders, Hamburgh, and the States,
cannot but in process of time work a great change and dangerous issue to
the people of the realm, who, heretofore, in time of outward peace,
lived thereby, and without it must either perish for want, or fall into
violence to feed and fill their lewd appetites with open spoils of
others,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span> which is the fruit of rebellion; but it is in vain to remember
this to your Lordship, that is so notorious as there need no repetition
thereof. The evil being seen and like daily to increase beyond all good
remedies, it is our duties that are Councillors to think of some
remedies in time, before the same become remediless; and briefly the
best means of remedy must follow the consideration of the causes of this
evil, and so <i>contrariis contraria curare</i>. The original cause is
apparently the contentions and enmities betwixt the King of Spain and
his countries, and her Majesty and her countries. The reduction hereof
to amity betwixt the Princes, and to open traffic according to the
ancient treaties of intercourse, would be the sovereign remedy; but this
may be wished sooner than speedily effectuated. But yet, seeing there is
a signification notified of the good inclination of both the Princes,
and a great necessity to press them both thereto for the suagement of
their people, it were pity any course should be taken either to hinder
this or not to hasten it, which surely in the Low Countries would be
done, with whatsoever a reasonable cost may be, to keep the enemy from
victuals, and to withstand his enterprises against our friends until
this next harvest; and by this proceeding against him, there is no doubt
but he will yield to all reasonable conditions meet both for her Majesty
and her protected friends; otherwise, if the good fortune of our friends
do decay, and the enemy recover that which he now lacketh, that is store
of victuals, he will either underhand make peace with our friends, whom
he shall find both weak and timorous, and leave her Majesty in danger
for recovery of all that she hath spent, and in greater charges to
maintain her two cautionary towns against the whole Low Countries than
two Boulognes were, or else he will, being puffed with pride, make a
very Spanish conquest of Holland and Zealand,&mdash;a matter terrible to be
thought of, but most terrible to be felt. But to insist upon this remedy
is as yet in vain, and therefore such other poor helps are to be thought
of as may somewhat mitigate the accidents present, and stay the increase
thereof, whereof when I do bethink myself, I find no one simple remedy,
but rather compounded of divers simples, and to say truly they are but
simple remedies, until peace may ensue, which is the sovereign sole
medicine of all. To have vent increase, there must be more buyers and
shippers than there are, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span> seeing our merchants say that they cannot
have sales sufficient,</p>

<p>1. It were good that the Steelyard men were licensed to trade as they
were wont to do, with condition upon good bonds that our merchants
adventurers shall have their former liberties in Hamburgh;</p>

<p>2. These Steelyard merchants must also have a dispensation to carry a
competent number of unwrought cloths that are coarse, which are the
cloths whereof the great stay is in the Realm.</p>

<p>3. Beside this, the merchant strangers might have a like dispensation
for the buying and shipping of a competent number of like white coarse
cloths.</p>

<p>4. And if her Majesty, for some reasonable time, would abate only 2s.
upon a cloth, I think there would grow no loss to her Majesty, having
respect to the multitude of the cloths that should be carried, whereas
now the strangers carry few, but upon licences, for which her Majesty
hath no strangers' customs, but English.</p>

<p>5. The strangers also must have liberty to buy in Blackwell Hall, or
else there may be a staple set up in Westminster, out of the liberties
of the City of London, which, rather than London would suffer, I think
they will grant liberty to strangers in respect to the hallage money
which they shall lease. Notwithstanding all these shows of remedies, I
could wish that our merchants adventurers were made acquainted herewith,
and to be warned, that if they shall not amend the prices to clothiers
for their coarse cloths, whereby the clothiers may be reasonably
apparent gainers, and that to be put in practice this next week, that
then her Majesty will give authority to put the former helps in
practice. Thus, my good Lord, because I understand you are to go to the
Court this afternoon, I have thought good to scribble, as I do (lying in
pain) these few cogitations, submitting them to a more mature
disquisition.</p>

<p>
Your Lordship's most assured,

<p>15. <span class="smcap"><a name="Instructions_Touching_the_Bill_for_Free_Trade" id="Instructions_Touching_the_Bill_for_Free_Trade"></a>Instructions Touching the Bill for Free Trade</span> [<i>Journals of
the House of Commons, Vol. I, p. 218</i>], 1604.</p>

<p>The Committees from the House of the Commons sat five whole afternoons
upon these Bills; there was a great concourse of clothiers and
merchants, of all parts of the realm, and especially of London; who were
so divided, as that all the clothiers, and, in effect, all the merchants
of England, complained grievously of the engrossing and restraint of
trade by the rich merchants of London, as being to the undoing, or great
hindrance, of all the rest; and of London merchants, three parts joined
in the same complaint against a fourth part; and of that fourth part,
some standing stiffly for their own company, yet repined at other
companies. Divers writings and informations were exhibited on both
parts; learned Counsel was heard for the Bill, and divers of the
principal Aldermen of London against it; all reasons exactly weighed and
examined; the Bill, together with the reasons on both sides, was
returned and reported by the Committees to the House; where, at the
third reading, it was three several days debated, and in the end passed
with great consent and applause of the House (as being for the exceeding
benefit of all the land) scarce forty voices dissenting from it.</p>

<p>The most weighty reasons for the enlargement of trade were these:</p>

<p><i>Natural Right.</i>&mdash;All free subjects are born inheritable, as to their
land, so also to the free exercise of their industry in those trades,
whereto they apply themselves and whereby they are to live. Merchandize
being the chief and richest of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span> other, and of greater extent and
importance than all the rest, it is against the natural right and
liberty of the subjects of England to restrain it into the hands of some
few, as now it is; for although there may be now some five or six
thousand persons, counting children and prentices, free of the several
Companies of the Merchants, in the whole; yet apparent it is, that the
Governors of these Companies, by their monopolizing orders, have so
handled the matter, as that the mass of the whole trade of all the realm
is in the hands of some two hundred persons at the most, the rest
serving for a shew only, and reaping small benefit.</p>

<p><i>Judgement of Parliament.</i>&mdash;The law stands for it; and a law made 12th
of Henry the Seventh, never repealed by Parliament, only restrained
since by charters, unduly, or by untrue suggestions, procured (by which
means all other monopolies have had their original) and the first of
those charters since the making of that statute (which was purchased in
the end of the reign of Henry the Seventh, at what time Empson and
Dudley were instruments of so much wronging and oppressing the people)
yet doth in no wise restrain this liberty of free trade, but expressly
allow it (with a reverence unto that very act in the 12th of this reign)
and so continued till the reign of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p><i>Examples of Nations.</i>&mdash;The example of all other nations generally in
the world, who avoid in themselves, and hate in us, this monopolizing
way of traffic; for it cannot be otherwise counted than a monopoly, when
so large a commodity is restrained into the hands of so few in
proportion, to the prejudice of all other who by law and natural right
might have interest therein. And whereas some allege that there are like
Companies in other countries, as of the East Indies in Lesbone, the
House of Contraction there, the Fontego at Venice, the Travesana at
Noremberg, these allegations are either untrue or unproper. There are
places of assembly for merchants, and to consult for good orders in all
other countries, but without restraint of trading from any man; and how
traffic, by this freedom, doth flourish in other countries, and
principally in the Low Countries, far more than in ours, is apparent to
all the world.</p>

<p><i>Wealth.</i>&mdash;The increase of the wealth generally of all the land by the
ready vent of all the commodities to the merchants at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span> higher rate; for
where many buyers are, ware grows dearer; and they that buy dear at
home, must sell dear abroad: this also will make our people more
industrious.</p>

<p><i>Equal Distribution.</i>&mdash;The more equal distribution of the wealth of the
land, which is a great stability and strength to the realm, even as the
equal distributing of the nourishment in a man's body; the contrary
whereof is inconvenient in all estates, and oftentimes breaks out into
mischief, when too much fullness doth puff up some by presumption, and
too much emptiness leaves the rest in perpetual discontent, the mother
of desire of innovations and troubles: and this is the proper fruit of
monopolies. Example may be in London, and the rest of the realm: The
custom and impost of London come to a hundred and ten thousand pound a
year, and of the rest of the whole realm but to seventeen thousand
pound.</p>

<p><i>Strength.</i>&mdash;The increase of shipping, and especially of mariners, in
all ports in England. How greatly the mariners of the realm have decayed
in all places of latter times, and with how great danger of the state in
these late wars, is known to them who have been employed in that kind of
service; who do also attribute the cause thereof to this restraint of
trade; free traffic being the breeder and maintainer of ships and
mariners, as by memorable example in the Low Countries may be seen.</p>

<p><i>Profit of the Crown.</i>&mdash;The increase of custom and subsidy to the King,
which doth necessarily follow the increase of foreign traffic and
wealth. And they which say otherwise, will dare to say anything. These
reasons are in great part set down in the Act of the 12th of Henry
VIIth; other particular reasons there are, which this present time doth
not yield.</p>

<p><i>Opportunity Abroad.</i>&mdash;Under our gracious Salamon, a Prince of wisdom
and peace, we are like to be in league or amity with all nations;
whereby, as there will be greater freedom abroad to trade to all places,
so fit to have greater at home for all persons to trade. This alteration
of times may make that fit now, which in times of hostility might have
seemed unfit.</p>

<p><i>Necessity at Home.</i>&mdash;And as there will be greater opportunity abroad,
so also much greater necessity at home; for what else shall become of
gentlemen's younger sons, who cannot live by arms when there is no wars,
and learning preferments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span> are common to all and mean? So that nothing
remains fit for them, save only merchandize (and such is the use of
other politic nations) unless they turn serving men, which is a poor
inheritance.</p>

<p>The general reasons to continue the restraint of trade, and the answer
to them, were these:</p>

<p><i>Imputation of the State.</i>&mdash;It is a taint to the King and State, that
these restrained companies should be called or counted monopolies; and
by this Act we insist and strengthen the complaint of the Haven Towns
and other nations against the State for suffering such companies.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;The same reason doth justify all the monopolies that ever
were. It is no touch to the State if abuses creep in, but if
reformation, desired by parliament, be denied. But surely this taint
doth no ways attaint his Majesty, who hath declared himself a just enemy
to all these unjust monopolies.</p>

<p><i>Not Monopolies.</i>&mdash;These Companies are not monopolies; for a monopoly
is, when liberty of selling, due to all men by right, is restrained to
one, with prejudice of all others.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;The name of monopoly, though taken originally for personal
unity, yet is fitly extended to all improportionable paucity of the
sellers in regard of the ware which is sold. If ten men had the only
sale of all the horses in England, this were a monopoly; much more the
Company of Merchant Adventurers, which, in effect not above two hundred,
have the managing of the two third parts of the clothing of this realm,
which might well maintain many thousand merchants more. And with how
great prejudice this is sundry ways to all the land, let example
suffice; let the cry of all the clothiers of England testify, and the
utter overthrow of infinite poor persons, which live by them and their
works. For the clothiers having no utterance of their cloth but to the
merchant adventurers, they, by complot among themselves, will buy but at
what time, what quality, and what price themselves list; whereby the
clothiers are fain often to return with loss, to lay their cloths to
pawn, to slack their trade, to the utter ruin of their poor workmen,
with their wives and children.</p>

<p><i>Keeping up our Commodities.</i>&mdash;These Companies keep up the price of our
commodities abroad, by avoiding an over-glut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span> of our commodities in
places whereto they trade. And this experience doth witness; for our
cloth is of late years much dearer than in former times; whereas
contrarywise, when trade is free, many sellers will make ware cheap and
of less estimation.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;It is true that all monopolies keep up their commodities for
their own private lucre; but they do it unjustly, and to the discontent
of all other men; which hath been the cause of so many edicts of the
Empire against the Company of Merchant Adventurers, which hath driven
them so often to shift their marts; and is the cause, that our merchants
are so generally hated, no other nation Christian either using or
enduring such restrained Companies in matter of merchandizes. Howbeit
both by reason and experience we may conjecture that there is no greater
[<i>blank</i>] that if trade be made free, our commodities will much abate
their price abroad; for the merchants must first buy their commodities
at home; and where many buyers are, wares will grow dearer; and buying
dear at home, he must sell dear abroad. For it is not true that there
will be a greater glut of our commodities in foreign parts; the sellers
will be more, but the wares sold will be much the same, especially in
those principal commodities, which grow out of the land. It is the store
of the merchandize, not the multitude of merchants, which doth make
things cheaper. Besides, when trade is free, it is likely that many
young men will seek out new places, and trade further for great benefit;
whereby the glut in the former places will be less.</p>

<p>The weakness of their argument of experience is plain; for not cloth
only, but all other things in the world are risen greatly in price; and
in France, where there is no Companies, our kerseys are sold at
exceeding good price, and as dear, in proportion, as broad cloths by the
Merchant Adventurers. But if it were so, that they kept up our
commodities abroad, so do they, by the same skill, foreign commodities
at home: so a few rich men do gain by their out-going, and the whole
land doth lose much more by their return. They say that they gain little
by return of foreign commodities. There lieth a mystery, for it is true,
and will be avowed upon certain knowledge, that upon the arrival of the
Merchant Adventurers' fleet, the commodities, on the other side, are
ordinarily raised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span> at least twenty in the hundred; for so do they quit
one wrong with another. But hereby the loss still falls heavy on the
subject, who is damnified now again in the commodities returned, as he
was before in the engrossing of those which were issued.</p>

<p><i>Venting all Now.</i>&mdash;The Companies that now are, do vent all the
commodities of the land, and yet are they hardly able to live one by
another.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;It is not all vented, which the land might spare; and that by
reason of the courses held by these Companies, to their own excessive
gain, and certain loss of all other men: besides, when traffic shall
flourish with us, as doth in other countries, where trade is free, and
namely in the Low Countries, who thereby have supported the huge charge
of their long wars, things merchantable will increase daily by this
encouragement to the subjects' industry, even as there they do; for
natural commodities are more than trebled by access of art and industry;
and howsoever, yet the division of wealth will be more equal; for now,
by the plotting of the governor of these Companies, some few overgrown
men devour the wealth, and make merry, whilst the rest, even of their
own Companies, do want and weep.</p>

<p><i>Prenticeship Necessary.</i>&mdash;This Act makes it lawful to become merchants
without prenticeship; which is an injury to them which have served, and
hurt to them that serve not; who, venturing unskilfully, shall be sure
of loss.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;The loss of new merchants, it may be, is as much the desire,
as fear of the objectors; but they that have served, have their skill
for their labour; and they that serve not, must be at charge of a
factor, or join with their friends, and learn skill by them; or at least
wise men adventure their stocks with other men, after the fashion of the
Low Countries, and other places, where trade doth flourish. By the same
reason young gentlemen might be kept from their lands, for want of skill
to govern them.</p>

<p><i>Dissolving Companies.</i>&mdash;This Act, by enlarging the Companies, and
giving free access to all men, doth in effect dissolve them; for hardly
are they able to govern those that are in already; and where government
faileth, there will be certain confusion.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;This Act dissolveth no Company, taketh away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span> no good
government. Those orders in Companies, which tend to monopoly, it
abrogateth: orders for necessary contribution to public charges it
establisheth; the rest it leaves as it found them, neither in worse
state, nor better. It is weakness to say, that a greater multitude
cannot be governed; for so neither Kings in their Dominions and
subjects, nor cities in their amplitude should increase. If for matter
of merchandize there were no such government at all, nor more than there
is for our merchants in France, or hath been at Stade, for divers years
past, or than there is in the Low Countries, where are the best
merchants in the world; yet provident men would consult and join
together in that which were for their common benefit, ease, and safety.
Such Companies there are in other countries, but no such monopolies as
ours are.</p>

<p><i>Joint Stock Necessary.</i>&mdash;This Act is against trading in a joint stock
together, which in long and dangerous voyages (as to Musco, and
especially the East Indies) is necessary; for in that voyage one alone
will not adventure; besides the merchants must keep some port there
amongst the infidels.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;It is true that it is fit to trade to the East Indies with a
joint stock, and so do the Hollanders; this Act therefore doth not
forbid men to trade in a joint stock, if they list, and see it fit; only
forbiddeth to constrain men to trade so against their wills; which
heretofore in other trades, and at this day in the Muscovie trade, doth
turn to the great damage both of the Commonwealth and of the particular
persons so constrained to trade. The Muscovie Company, consisting of
eight score, or thereabouts, have fifteen directors, who manage the
whole trade; these limit to every man the proportion of stock which he
shall trade for, make one purse and stock of all, and consign it into
the hands of one agent at Musco, and so again, at their return, to one
agent at London, who sell all, and give such account as they please.
This is a strong and a shameful monopoly&mdash;a monopoly in a monopoly&mdash;both
abroad and at home. A whole Company, by this means, is become as one
man, who alone hath the uttering of all the commodities of so great a
country. The inconveniences, which have ensued thereof, are three
apparent.</p>

<p>First, by this means they vent less of our commodities; for, by reason
of the one agent, they vent all through his hands;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span> by which means the
Hollanders have come in between us; who, trading thither in several with
our own English commodities (which are most proper for that country)
utter much more than our own merchants, and make quicker return; which
has occasioned many Englishmen to join in trade with the Hollanders, to
the detriment of the King's Majesty in his customs. And by this means
that trade is like utterly to decay; for the Hollanders have grown in
short time from two ships to above twenty; this spring they are gone to
Muscovie with near thirty ships, and our men but with seven. The like
fell out in the Turkie Company, when they constrained men to a joint
stock; since the breaking of which combination, there go four ships for
one.</p>

<p>Secondly, in their return with Muscovie commodities, they greatly
prejudice the Commonwealth and State. Example in cordage, which they
bring home in such scarcity, and sell so dearly, as that they have
raised it in short time from twenty to thirty shillings; yea, to sell
their ware dear, they have contracted with the buyer not to bring any
more of that commodity within three years after.</p>

<p>Thirdly, this is hurtful to all the young merchants of their own
Company, who cannot forbear their stock so long as now they do, and
desire to employ their own industry in managing it, and having
oftentimes been all damnified by the breaking of that general factor.</p>

<p><i>Public Charges.</i>&mdash;In divers places, as namely, in Turkey and Muscovy,
the merchants are at charge of sending presents, maintaining
ambassadors, consuls, and agents, which are otherwise also necessary for
the service of his Majesty, and of the State; these charges are now
defrayed by these Companies.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;This matter is expressly provided for by this Act, that all
that trade to those places shall be contributory to those charges.</p>

<p><i>The New Merchants will give over.</i>&mdash;The like attempt for free trade was
in Anno 1588, at what time liberty being given to all men to buy cloths
at Westminster, the Merchant Adventurers gave over to trade at all;
whereby the cloth of the land lying on the clothier's hands, they were
forced, by petition, to get the former restraint restored.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;This is true, and the same mischief were likely to ensue
again; for it is said, that the same policy is now in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span> speech in their
Company. But the times being well altered from war to peace, this
mischief would be but short, and other merchants soon grow to take their
places, if they should, as (being rich) they may, forsake them. But it
were to be trusted that this stomachness, being to their own loss, would
not long continue. Howsoever, it doth not stand with the dignity of
parliament either to fear or favour the frowardness of any subject.</p>

<p><i>The Rich will eat out the Poor.</i>&mdash;If poor merchants should trade
together with the rich, the rich beyond the seas would buy out the poor,
being not able to sell at the instant, to make themselves savers; and so
there would grow a monopoly <i>ex facto</i>.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;This reason sheweth thus much, that a crafty head, with a
greedy heart, and a rich purse, is able to take advantage of the need of
his neighbour (which no man doubteth of); but if the difficulties and
dishonesties should deter men from action, and not rather increase their
diligence and wariness, then should there be no trading at all in any
sort.</p>

<p><i>Strangers will eat out the English.</i>&mdash;If all men may be merchants, the
sons of strangers denized will, in time, eat out the natural merchants
of this kingdom.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;If the sons of strangers become natural English, why should
they not [have] a subject's part? And more they cannot reap. If any
further mischief should grow, it might at all times by a new Act be
easily remedied.</p>

<p><i>All Men may go out of the Realm.</i>&mdash;If trade be free for all men, then
all may become merchants, and under that pretext any may go out of the
realm; which will be good news for the papists.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;This conceit is weak; for so it may be said that all men may
become mariners, and so quit the kingdom; and it is provided by express
words of the bill that they may not go out of the realm but for their
present traffic.</p>

<p><i>Against London.</i>&mdash;This Act is against London, and the wealth thereof,
which is necessary to be upheld, being the head city of the kingdom.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Nay, it is for London, unless we will confine London into
some two hundred men's purses; the rest of the City of London, together
with the whole realm, sue mainly for this bill; and they cry, they are
undone, if it should be crossed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hurt to the King's Customs.</i>&mdash;It will be prejudicial to the King's
customs, who in other parts will easier be deceived than here in London.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Nothing can be more clear than that if transport and return
of merchandize will increase by this Act, also the King's customs, which
depend thereon, must withal increase: And if this Bill may pass, if the
King be pleased to let his custom to farm, to give 5,000<i>l.</i> a year more
than, <i>communibus annis</i>, hath been made these last years. The deceiving
of the King is now, when, for want of this freedom, men are enforced to
purchase the vent of their commodities out of creeks, because they
cannot be admitted to public trade; whereas otherwise they should have
no reason to hazard their whole estate, for the saving of so reasonable
a duty. As for faults in officers, they may as well happen in London, as
in any other place.</p>

<p><i>Decay of Great Ships.</i>&mdash;During freedom of trade, small ships would be
employed to vent our commodities, and so our great ships, being the
guard of the land, would decay.</p>

<p>It is war, more than traffic that maintaineth great ships; and
therefore, if any decay grow, it will be chiefly by peace, which the
wisdom of the State will have a regard of; but for as much depends of
traffic, no doubt the number of smaller ships will grow by this freedom,
and especially mariners, whereof the want is greatest, and of whom the
smallest vessels are the proper nurseries. But that the great ships will
decay, doth not necessarily follow; for the main trade of all the white
cloth, and much of other kind, is shipped from the Port of London, and
will be still, it being the fittest Port of the kingdom for Germanie and
the Low Countries, where the Merchant Adventurers' trade only lieth; who
shall have little cause to alter their shipping. Then the Levent Sea,
Muscovy, and East Indies, whither we trade with great ships, the
employing of them will be still requisite in the merchants' discretion;
for otherwise both the commodity of the returned will be less, and the
adventure too great in so rich lading not to provide for more than
ordinary assurance against the common hazard at sea.</p>

<p>Other particular reasons there are, for restraint of trade in favour of
certain Company.</p>

<p><i>Merchant Adventurers.</i>&mdash;The Company of Merchant Adven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>turers is very
ancient, and they have heretofore been great credit to the Kings, for
borrowing money in the Low Countries and Germany.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;The Company indeed is as ancient as Thomas of Beckett, their
founder, and may still continue. Their restraining of others, which this
Bill doth seek to redress, is not so ancient, and was so disallowed by
parliament in the twelfth year of Henry the seventh; which Act stands
impeached by particular charter, but never by consent of the realm
repealed. But in truth this Company, being the spring of all monopolies,
and engrossing the grand staple commodities of cloth into so few men's
hands, deserves least favour. The credit of the King hath been in the
cloth (not in their persons) which will be as much hereafter, as
heretofore.</p>

<p><i>Muscovy Company.</i>&mdash;The Muscovy Company, by reason of the chargeable
invention of that trade two and fifty years since, and their often great
loss, was established by Act of Parliament in the eighth year of Queen
Elizabeth.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;The chargeable invention hath been a reason worthy of respect
thirty or forty years ago, when the inventors were living, and their
charge not recompensed by counter-vailable gain; which since it hath
been their loss, hath been their own fault, in employing one factor, who
hath abused them all. Private Acts for favour, when the cause thereof is
ceased, are often revoked. Howbeit this Bill dissolveth no Company, only
enlargeth them, and abrogateth their unjust orders for monopolies.</p>

<p><i>An Argument Unanswerable.</i>&mdash;Another argument there is, not to be
answered by reason, but by their integrity and love of their country,
who shall be assaulted with it. In sum, the Bill is a good Bill, though
not in all points, perhaps, so perfect as it might be; which defects may
be soon remedied and supplied in future parliament.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Sir Edward Sandys proceeded in the report, and delivered in the two
Bills for free trade; the first (being the principal Bill) with
amendments; which were twice read; and the Bill, upon question, ordered
to be ingrossed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>

p. 2</i>], 1616-17.</p>

<p>James by the Grace of God, etc.:</p>

<p>We have often and in divers manners expressed ourselves ... what an
earnest desire and constant resolution we have that, as the reducing of
wools into clothing was the act of our noble Progenitor King Edward the
Third, so the reducing of the trade of white cloths, which is but an
imperfect thing towards the wealth and good of this our Kingdom, unto
the trade of cloths dyed and dressed, might be the work of our time,</p>

<p>To which purpose we did first invite the ancient Company of Merchant
Adventurers to undertake the same, who upon allegation or pretence of
impossibility refused.</p>

<p>Whereupon nevertheless not discouraged but determined to maintain our
princely resolution against impediments and difficulties in a work so
excellent, We did find means to draw and procure divers persons of good
quality within our City of London and elsewhere with great alacrity and
commendable zeal to give a beginning to this our purpose,</p>

<p>In respect whereof, for that above all things We were to take a princely
care that between the cessation of the old trade and the inception and
settling of the new there should not be any stand of cloth nor failing
or deadness in the vent thereof, whereby the work which is so good for
the future might prove dangerous in the entrance thereof, we were
inforced to grant several licences under our Great Seal unto the said
persons for a trade of whites to be temporary and in the interim until
this work by due and seasonable degrees without inconvenience of
precipitation might be happily accomplished, giving them likewise some
powers of assembling, keeping of Courts and the like, but yet without
any actual incorporation of them,</p>

<p>But notwithstanding, having evermore in contemplation our first end, We
have still provoked and urged on the said persons unto whom the trade is
now transferred to some certainty of offer and undertaking concerning a
proportion of cloths dressed and dyed to be annually exported, and the
same proportion to increase and multiply in such sort as may be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
fruitful beginning of so good a work and also an assured pledge of the
continuation thereof in due time.</p>

<p>Whereupon the said persons or new Company have before the Lords of our
Privy Council absolutely condescended and agreed at a Court holden the
seventeenth day of June one thousand six hundred and fifteen, that
thirty-six thousand cloths shall be dressed and dyed out of such cloths
white as were formerly used to be shipped out by the old Company
undressed and undyed....</p>

<p>... And did further promise and profess with all cheerfulness to proceed
as it shall please God to give ability and the trade encouragement to
the settling of the whole trade of cloths dressed and dyed, which is the
end desired.</p>

<p>Wherefore We, in our princely judgement foreseeing that as long as the
said new Company shall remain not incorporated it doth much weaken both
the endeavour and expectation which belongeth to this work, as if it
were a thing but only in deliberation and agitation and not fully and
thoroughly established, have thought it now a fit time to extend our
princely grace unto them for their incorporation and to indue and invest
them with such liberties and privileges as the old Company formerly had,
with such additions and augmentations as the merit of concurrence to so
good an end may require, with this, nevertheless, that because the
nature of the present liberties and privileges must of necessity differ
from those which shall be fit and requisite when the whole trade shall
be overcome and settled, there be therefore a power in Us to revoke or
alter the same.</p>

<p>Know ye therefore that We ... by these presents have given, granted and
confirmed, and for Us our heirs and successors do give, grant and
confirm, unto our right trusty and right well beloved Cousin and
Counsellor Thomas, Earl of Suffolk, Lord High Treasurer of England [and
others named], and to every of them, and to all and every such person
and persons whatsoever our loving subjects as shall, between this and
the feast of St. Michael the Archangel next ensuing come in, subscribe,
and be admitted of their Society, That they and every of them, their and
every of their sons and apprentices according to the constitutions and
ordinances hereafter by the Company to be made and presented, shall be

<p>[Power to have common seal, etc.]: [There shall be one Governor, William
Cokayne, Alderman of our City of London, to be the first and present

<p>And moreover We ... do by these presents grant unto the said
[Fellowship, etc.] that the said Governor, Deputy and Assistants, or
thirteen of them at the least, and their successors for the time being
from time to time and at all times from henceforth, shall and may enact,

said [Fellowship, etc.]</p>

<p>... And also We will, and for Us, our heirs and successors, by these
presents do grant to the said [Fellowship] that the said [Fellowship or

<p>And, for the better encouragement of the said Company or Fellowship ...
We do hereby for Us our heirs and successors straitly charge and command

<p>And for the better encouragement of the said [Fellowship] to proceed in
exportation of cloths dressed and dyed here in this our Realm, which
will tend so much to the common weal of the same, and which by the said
Company or Fellowship cannot as yet in such full manner be perfected as
that they can have sufficient vent for the said dressed and dyed cloths
in foreign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span> parts without a temporary liberty to export cloths white,
until by continuance of time they shall be further enabled and
encouraged, We do by these presents ... give and grant unto the said

wares, commodities, goods and merchandises already not prohibited as to
them or any of them their servants, factors or agents shall seem good,
paying to Us our heirs and successors our duties and customs due and to
be paid for the same, and further paying unto our trusty and
well-beloved Cousin the Earl of Cumberland, his executors or assigns,
for every white unwrought or undressed woollen cloth so to be by them or
any of them shipped or transported out of this Realm under the warrant

two shillings and eight pence....</p>

<p>And our will and pleasure is, and We do hereby declare our Royal intent

and agree to and with Us our heirs and successors by these presents,
that they and their successors shall from time to time and at all times
do their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span> utmost endeavours that after the end and expiration of the
said three years ensuing, during which the proportion of thirty-six
thousand cloths are undertaken to be exported as is before in these
presents expressed, that their trade of exporting and merchandising into
the foresaid countries, provinces, towns and places aforesaid of woollen
cloths may be wholly reduced unto the venting of such cloths only as
shall be dyed and dressed here within this our Realm and other our
Dominions, so far forth as it shall please God to give them and their
successors ability and the trade encouragement, anything in these
presents contained to the contrary notwithstanding: ...</p>

<p>... Provided also that these our Letters Patents or any matter or thing
therein contained shall not extend to give authority or power to the
said [Fellowship of the King's Merchants, etc.] or to any member or
person of the said Company to transport or carry out of the realm any
cloths, kersies, wares, commodities or merchandises whatsoever, which by
the laws and statutes of this Realm are restrained or prohibited to be
transported or carried over the seas, otherwise than according to the
true intent and meaning of these presents, unless they shall obtain and
procure licence for the same.</p>

<p>Means to avoid the present stand of cloth&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Commissioners honest and substantial and sufficient for skill to be
presently appointed for the view of the cloth weekly to Blackwell Hall,
and the faulty cloth to be returned upon the clothier with imprisonment
till he put in security to answer it in the law; and the good to be
justly valued, according to the usual prices for these two years past,
and the new Merchant Adventurers enforced to buy the same.</p>

<p>(2) So many of the new Merchant Adventurers as shall refuse to lay out
for cloth such sums as they have subscribed for to be presently
committed, to abide the censure of the Star Chamber for abusing of his
Majesty and the State in so desperate and dangerous a case as this is.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) The fines of them to be employed in the buying of cloth for the
riddance of the market.</p>

<p>(4) So many in London as are thought worth 10,000<i>l.</i> to be moved by my
Lord Mayor to buy up clothes for 1,000<i>l.</i> at the least; especially all
woollen drapers of half that worth, viz., 5,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>(5) Express commandment and present example of King's Counsellors and
Courtiers and all their servants to wear nothing but broad cloth in
their gowns, cloaks, girths, robes or breeches till Easter next, to the
end that woollen drapers may be encouraged to buy the cloth made or to
be made before that day; or else on pain of imprisonment not to come
into Court....</p>

<p>(10) And if it be doubtful whether these proceedings agree with law, the
answer is that they do, for the law giveth place to parlous cases of
State and leaveth them to be provided for by the wisdom of the King and
his Counsellors; and <i>Salus reipublic&aelig; suprema lex est</i>, which is a
sufficient answer to all cavillers and peevish lawyers.</p>

<p>James, by the grace of God, etc., to all to whom these presents shall
come, greeting.</p>

<p>Whereas We, by our letters patents ... did give and grant unto our
well-beloved subjects Roger Jones and Andrew Palmer, their executors,
administrators, and assigns, full and free liberty, license, power,
privilege, and authority that they, ... and none other, by themselves,
their deputies, servants, factors, or workmen, should or might at all
and every time and times thereafter, and from time to time, during the
term of twenty and one years next ensuing the date of the said letters
patents, ... use, exercise, practice, and put in use ... the mistery,
art, way, means, and trade of "making of hard soap with the material
called barilla, and without the use of any fire in the boiling and
making thereof, and also of the making of soft soap without the use of
fire in the boiling thereof," with such privileges and clauses as in
said letters patents are contained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span> and may more at large appear: And
whereas since the granting of the said letters patents the said Roger
Jones and Andrew Palmer, and such others, their assistants, as by great
expense and travail have aided and assisted them in perfecting the said
invention, have found out and added to their former invention many
particulars conducing much to the profitableness and perfection of the
work, both in the use of native and home commodities of this kingdom in
the working and composition of the said soaps, and thereby in sparing
and saving many thousands yearly which are now expended on foreign
commodities bought and brought from beyond the seas, and employed here
in the making of soap, in the manner now ordinarily used; ... Forasmuch
as such profitable inventions are not at once and at the first brought
to their full perfection, We hold it fit in justice and honour to give
all encouragement to such our loving subjects as shall employ their
travails, industries, and purses to the furthering of the common good,
and to reward them to the full with the fruits of their own labours; and
forasmuch also as the said Roger Jones and Andrew Palmer have now
approved their inventions and skill to be such as deserveth
encouragement, their soap, made (<i>blank</i>) the material of our kingdom
only, being found to be as sweet and good as the best soft soap now
already made, and to extend further in the use thereof, as they in the
behalf of themselves and their assistants have also made offer unto us
to respect our own particular profit, in such measure as that the loss
we may receive in our customs and other duties by the not importing of
foreign commodities for the making of soap as in former times, shall by
their industries be recommended unto us, our heirs, and successors, in
certainty with good advantage; and our loving subjects, who have long
complained of the bad and stinking soap now ordinarily in use, shall
have good, sweet, and serviceable soap for their money, and yet shall
not have the price thereof raised upon them above the usual rate of the
best sweet soap now made and sold by the soap-boilers.</p>

<p>Know ye, that We, for the considerations aforesaid, of our especial
grace, certain knowledge, and mere motion, have given and granted, and
by these presents, for us, our heirs and successors, do give and grant
unto the said Roger Jones and Andrew Palmer on the behalf of themselves
and their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span> assistants, full and free liberty, license, power, privilege
and authority that they, the said Roger Jones and Andrew Palmer, their
executors, administrators, and assigns, by themselves or their deputies,
servants, factors, or workmen, and none other, shall and may at all and
every time and times hereafter, and from time to time during the term of
twenty and one years next ensuing the date of these presents, at their
own proper costs and charges, use, exercise, practice, and put in use,
within our said realms of England and Ireland and dominion of Wales, and
our town of Berwick, at their liberty and pleasure, the mistery, art,
way and means of making of hard soap and soft soap, as well with the
materials and in such manner as in the said former letters patents are
expressed, as also of burning and preparing of bean-straw, pea-straw,
kelp, fern, and other vegetables to be found in our own dominions, into
ordinary ashes or into potashes, and with the said materials of the
ashes of bean or pea straw, and kelp, fern, and all other vegetables
whatsoever not formerly and ordinarily used or practised within these
our realms and dominions to make soap hard or soft, at their will and
pleasure, and in such way or form as they have invented or devised; and
also of the using of the assay glass for trying of their lye and making
of hard and soft soap by their said new inventions, in the way of making
of the said soaps by sundry motions, and not boiling of the same with
the expense of much fuel, in such sort as was formerly accustomed by
such as now usually make soap in and about our city of London and
elsewhere in our said dominions; ... and to the end that this our
pleasure may be the better effected, and the said Roger Jones and Andrew
Palmer may the more fully enjoy the benefit of this our grant, We will,
and for us, our heirs and successors, do straightly charge, inhibit, and
command, and do also of our especial grace, certain knowledge, and mere
motion, for us, our heirs and successors, grant to the said Roger Jones
and Andrew Palmer, their executors, administrators, and assigns, that no
person or persons whatsoever born within any our realms or dominions,
nor any other person or persons whatsoever, either denizens or strangers
born in any foreign realm or country whatsoever, of what estate, degree,
or condition soever he or they be or shall be, other than the said Roger
Jones and Andrew Palmer, their executors, administrators, and assigns or
such as shall by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span> them or some of them be set on work or authorised,
shall or may, at any time or times during the said term of one and
twenty years hereby granted or mentioned, or intended to be granted,
practice, use, exercise, or put in use the said mistery, art, way,
means, or trade of making the said hard or soft soaps with any the
materials aforesaid, ... And to the end it may the better appear when
any such soap shall be made contrary to the true intent and meaning of
these presents, for us, our heirs, and successors, give and grant full
liberty, power, and authority unto the said Roger Jones and Andrew
Palmer, their executors, administrators, and assigns, that a stamp or
stamps, seal or seals, to be engraven with a rose and crown, shall be
stamped, sealed, or marked on all the soaps by them or any of them to be
made in manner and form before declared, the better to distinguish their
said soap from all counterfeit soap, either hard or soft, made or to be
made by any person or persons contrary to the true intent and meaning of
these presents or of the letters patents before recited, which seal or
stamp so to be made as aforesaid We do by these presents will and
command be set upon the hard soap, and upon the firkins, barrels, and
other vessels containing the said soft soap so to be made, and shall not
be set upon soaps hard or soft made by any other person or persons
whatsoever contrary to the true intent of these presents, but shall be
set and fixed only upon such soap as shall be from time to time made by
the said Roger Jones and Andrew Palmer, their executors, administrators,
or assigns, according as is herein before setdown, and no other; and
further, We do by these presents grant that it shall and may be lawful
to and for the said Roger Jones and Andrew Palmer, their executors,
administrators, or assigns, or any of them, by himself or themselves, or
by his, their, or any of their deputies, factors, or servants, at any
time or times convenient, and from time to time during the said term of
one and twenty years, with assistance of a constable or some other
officer, to enter into all and every place and places, house and houses,
where they or any of them shall have any just cause to suspect any such
hard soap or soft soap, or soap-ashes, or potashes, to be made or
endeavoured to be made or stamped or sealed, or to be sold or uttered or
set to sale, contrary to the true intent and meaning of these presents
or of the letters patents before recited, or any vessels, engines, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
instruments to be erected, framed, or used contrary to the true meaning
hereof, ... and finding any such, to seize the hard soaps and soft
soaps, and potashes, and other ashes hereby granted so made to the use
of us, our heirs, and successors: ... And forasmuch as the public having
an interest herein, which by the enhancing of the prices of the
commodities aforesaid may be prejudiced and damnified, our will and
pleasure is, and we do hereby straightly charge and command, that they
the said Roger Jones and Andrew Palmer, their executors, administrators,
and assigns, or any other person or persons by them to be authorised for
the making of the said hard soap or soft soap, shall not, at any time
during the said term of one and twenty years, sell, or cause to be sold,
the said hard soap or soft soap, by them or any of them to be made as
aforesaid, at any higher or dearer rates and prices than hard soap and
soft soap of the best sorts and kinds were most usually sold for, within
the space of seven years now last past before the date of these
presents. And further, We do hereby charge and command all and singular
justices of peace, mayors, sheriffs, constables, headboroughs,
comptrollers, customers, searchers, waiters, and all other officers and
ministers to whom it shall or may appertain, to be aiding and assisting
in all lawful and convenient manner unto the said Roger Jones and Andrew
Palmer, their executors, administrators, deputies, and assigns, in the
due execution of these our letters patents, as they tender our pleasure
and will avoid our indignation and displeasure in the contrary....</p>

Lord God one thousand six hundred and ten, publish in print to the whole
realm and to all posterity, that all grants of monopolies and of the
benefit of any penal laws, or of power to dispense with the law, or to
compound for the forfeiture, are contrary to your Majesty's laws ...;
and whereas your Majesty was further graciously pleased expressly to
command that no suitor should presume to move your Majesty for matters
of that nature: yet nevertheless upon misinformations and untrue
pretences of public good, many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span> such grants have been unduly obtained
and unlawfully put in execution, ...; for avoiding whereof and
preventing of all the like in time to come, may it please your Majesty,
at the humble suit of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons
in this present Parliament, that all monopolies and all commissions,
grants, licenses, charters, and letters patents heretofore made or
granted to any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate
whatsoever, of or for the sole buying, selling, making, working, or
using of anything within this realm or the dominion of Wales ... are

I, c. 9, Statutes of the Realm, Vol. IV, Part II, pp. 1218-19</i>], 1623-4.</p>

<p>Whereas the trade of making of Welsh clothes, friezes, linings and
plains within the principality and dominion of Wales, is and hath been
of long continuance, in the using and exercising whereof many thousands
of the poorer sort of the inhabitants there in precedent ages have been
set on work in spinning, carding, weaving, fulling, cottoning and
shearing, whereby they (having free liberty to sell them to whom and
where they would) not only relieved and maintained themselves and their
families in good sort, but also grew to such wealth and means of living
as they were thereby enabled to pay and discharge all duties, mizes,
charges, subsidies and taxations which were upon them imposed or rated
in their several counties, parishes and places wherein they dwelled, for
the relief of the poor,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span> and the service of the King and the
commonwealth; and whereas also the drapers of the town of Shrewsbury, in
the county of Salop, have of late obtained some orders of restraint,
whereby the inhabitants of Wales find themselves much prejudiced in the
freedom of their markets for buying and selling of their clothes, to
their great damage, as was verified by the general voice of the knights
and burgesses of the twelve shires of Wales and of the county of
Monmouth: for remedy whereof, be it declared and enacted by the King's
most excellent Majesty, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in
this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,
that it shall and may be lawful to and for all and every his Majesty's
subjects inhabiting or dwelling, or which at any time shall inhabit or
dwell within the said dominion of Wales, or any part thereof, freely to
sell by way of barter or otherwise, all or any their Welsh clothes,
cottons, friezes, linings or plains, at their wills and pleasures, to
any person or persons who lawfully by the laws and statutes of this
realm may buy the same; and that it shall and may also be lawful for any
person and persons who by the laws or statutes of this realm may
lawfully buy such clothes, and other the premises, freely to buy the
same of any person or persons inhabiting or dwelling, or which hereafter
shall inhabit or dwell, within the said dominion of Wales: any charter,
grant, act, order or any thing else heretofore made or done, or
hereafter to be made or done, to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p>And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall and
may be lawful to and for any person or persons using or which shall use
the trade of merchandize, to transport into any the parts beyond the
seas any of the said Welsh clothes, cottons, friezes, linings and
plains, out of any ports or havens within this realm of England or
dominion of Wales, or out of any the members thereof, where his majesty,
his heirs or successors, have or shall then have officers attending to
search, view and control the same, and to receive the King's Majesty's
customs and other duties due and payable for the same; so as always the
customs and other duties payable for such clothes and other premises so
to be transported, shall be justly and duly paid for the same; and so as
always the said Welsh clothes, cottons, friezes, linings and plains,
before the transporting thereof, shall be fulled, cottoned and sheared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
as in former times they have used to be; and that no person shall
transport the said clothes in other manner than as aforesaid, upon pain
to forfeit the whole value of such clothes so to be transported contrary
to the true meaning of this act....</p>

<p>Provided always, that this act or anything therein contained, shall not
give power or authority to any foreigner or foreigners to buy and sell
by way of retail any the said Welsh clothes, cottons, friezes, linings
or plains within the town of Shrewsbury, or in any other corporate town
or privileged place, contrary to any lawful charter, grant, custom,
privilege or liberty in the same town or place now being or used.</p>

Letters and Despatches of Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, Vol. II,
pp. 19, 20, Letters of Strafford to the Master of the Rolls, July 25,
1636</i>], 1636.</p>

<p>The last of my generals was that of trade, which I discoursed in this
manner; I let them see how the merchants trading thither had been
spoiled by the pirates before my coming, as well in his Majesty's
harbours, as at sea, a ship fired in the port of Dublin, in sight of His
Majesty's Castle, and there continued burning, and the pirate lading and
returning from the ship two days together to the mighty scandal of the
State; that the shipping for want of money came so late in the year,
that all the mischief was done before they came, which commonly was not
before the latter end of July, but that now the monies duly answered
unto the Exchequer here, the ships had been for these two last years
upon the coast by the beginning of March, five or six of the
<i>Biscayners</i> taken within the Channel, imprisoned, and after released
upon their promise not to exercise any hostility hereafter within the
Channel; a great ship of the Duke of <i>Macqueda</i> taken on the west coast,
and thereby so discouraged them, that the merchant hath not lost
anything since my arrival there, nor were so much as heard of a
<i>Biscayner</i> these last two summers. This hath been a means that Trade
hath increased exceedingly, and so will still (if we have peace), to the
honour of his Majesty, and the enriching of his people.</p>

<p>That the trade here was not only much greater, but rightly conditioned,
the native commodities exported being in value<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span> at least a third, if not
double, the value to the foreign commodities imported; a certain sign
that the Commonwealth gathers upon their neighbours.</p>

<p>That there was little or no manufacture amongst them, but some small
beginnings towards a clothing trade, which I had and so should still
discourage all I could, unless otherwise directed by his Majesty and
their lordships, in regard it would trench not only upon the clothings
of England, being our staple commodity, so as if they should manufacture
their own wools, which grew to very great quantities, we should not only
lose the profit we made now by indraping their wools, but his Majesty
lose extremely by his customs, and, in conclusion, it might be feared
they would beat us out of the trade itself, by underselling us, which
they were well able to do. Besides in reasons of State so long as they
did not indrape their own wools, they must of necessity fetch their
clothing from us, and consequently in a sort depend upon us for their
livelihood, and thereby become so dependent upon this Crown as they
could not depart from us without nakedness to themselves and children.
Yet have I endeavoured another way to set them on work, and that is by
bringing in the making and trade of linen cloth, the rather in regard
the women are all naturally bred to spinning, that the Irish earth is
apt for bearing of flax, and that this manufacture would be in the
conclusion rather a benefit than other to this Kingdom. I have therefore
sent for the flax seed into Holland, being of a better sort than we have
any, sown this year a thousand pounds worth of it (finding by some I sew
the last year, that it takes there very well), I have sent for workmen
out of the Low Countries and forth of France, and set up already six or
seven looms, which, if please God to bless us this year, I trust so to
invite them to follow it, when they see the great profit arising
thereby, as that they shall generally take to it and employ themselves
that way, which if they do I am confident it will prove a mighty
business, considering that in all probability we shall be able to
undersell the linen cloths of Holland and France at least twenty in the
hundred.</p>

<p>My humble advice in the conclusion for the increase of trade was, that
his Majesty should not suffer any act of hostility to be offered to any
merchants or their goods within the Channel, which was to be preserved
and privileged, as the greatest of his Majesty's ports, in the same
nature and property as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span> Venetian State do their Gulf, and the King
of Denmark his Sound, and therefore I humbly besought his Majesty and
their lordships that it might accordingly be remembered and provided for
in all future treaties with foreign princes.</p>

<p>Upon the summing up of all which, I did represent that Kingdom to his
Majesty and the lords as a growing people that would increase beyond all
expectation if it were now a little favoured in this their first spring,
and not discouraged by harder usage than either English or Scotch found.
The instances I gave were the imposition upon coals, wherein the Irish
were not treated as English, but as foreigners, by imposing four
shillings upon a tun, which was full as much as either French or Dutch
paid; next, that excessive rate set upon a horse or mare to be
transported forth of this Kingdom, so as I did not know how the army
should be provided for the King's service, there not being in that
Kingdom of their own breed to furnish those occasions; and lastly
eighteenpence set upon every live beast that comes thence, all which
will be a great discouragement for any to transplant themselves and
children into a country where they shall presently be dealt withal as
aliens, be denied the favours and the graces afforded to other subjects,
and utterly quell and cut off any increase of trade by nipping it and
overburdening it thus in the bud.</p>

found prejudicial and inconvenient to his people, contrary to his

Ordinances of the Interregnum, Vol. I, pp. 202-14</i>], 1643.</p>

<p>An ordinance for the speedy raising and levying of monies, set by way of
charge or new impost, on the several commodities mentioned in the
schedule hereunto annexed; as well for the securing of trade as for the
maintenance of the forces raised for the defence of the King and
Parliament, both by sea and land, as for and towards the payments of the
debts of the commonwealth, for which the public faith is, or shall be,
given.</p>

<p>The Lords and Commons now assembled in Parliament, taking into their
serious consideration the great danger that this kingdom lyeth under,
through the implacable malice and treachery of Papists and other wicked
persons; ... And forasmuch as many great levies have been already made
... which the well-affected party to the Protestant religion have
hitherto willingly paid, to their great charge, and the malignants of
this kingdom have hitherto practised by all cunning ways and means how
to evade and elude the payment of any part thereof; By reason whereof
the Lords and Commons do hold it fit that some constant and equal way
for the levying of monies for the future maintenance of the Parliament
forces ... may be ... established, whereby the said malignants and
neutrals may be brought to and compelled to pay their proportionable
parts of the aforesaid charge....</p>

<p>I. Be it therefore ordered, ordained and declared by the said Lords and
Commons, that the several rates and charges in a schedule hereunto
annexed and contained shall be set and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span> laid ... upon all and every the
commodities in the said schedule particularly expressed....</p>

<p>II. Be it further ordained ... that ... an office ... shall be ...
erected ... in the City of London, called ... by the name of the Office
of Excise or New Impost, whereof there shall be eight Commissioners to
govern the same....</p>

<p>V. That the like office and so many of such officers shall be ...
erected ... in all the counties of the realm of England, dominion of
Wales, and town of Berwick, and all other the cities ... as the said
eight Commissioners ... think fit to nominate....</p>

<p>VII. That the said office in all places where it shall be placed shall
be kept open in the week days from eight ... till eleven, and from two
till five ..., for the entering and registering the names and surnames,
as well of the sellers, buyers and makers of all and every the
commodities in the said schedule mentioned, and of the several qualities
thereof, as for the receiving of all monies as shall be due upon the
sale....</p>

<p>XI. That if any of the sellers of the said commodities shall refuse or
neglect to make a true entry of the said commodities ... that then he or
they ... shall forfeit to the use of the commonwealth four times the
true value of the goods and commodities so by him or them neglected to
be entered or delivered....</p>

<p>XV. That this ordinance shall begin to take place and effect from the
25th of July, 1643, and from thence to continue only for three years
then next ensuing, unless both Houses of Parliament, during that time,
shall declare that it shall continue for any longer time....</p>

<p>In this schedule is contained the charge and excise which ... is set and
imposed, to be paid on the several commodities hereafter mentioned.</p>

<p>The documents in this section are intended to illustrate changes in
industry and their effects on social conditions between 1660 and 1846.
Eight extracts illustrate the condition of industries in the period,
their structure, organisation and methods (Nos. 1 to 5, 7, 8 and 12).
The first five refer to the early part of the eighteenth century and
have a double interest. They record the old conditions in the woollen
industry and the wool, corn and coal trades, and enable us to estimate
the completeness of the change which was coming (Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
They show also how far advanced already was the organisation of markets
and middlemen, and vertical control. A description of the conditions of
the old apprenticeship system in the woollen industry is added (No. 8).
Evidence before Committees on the Coal Trade gives an account of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
important monopoly agreements and limitations of output which the
peculiar conditions of the industry produced (No. 7). An example of the
mechanical inventions which revolutionised industry at the close of the
period is taken from an autobiographical pamphlet by a pioneer in
power-loom cotton weaving (No. 12).</p>

<p>The pressure of industrial change on human life had been felt for some
time before the application of new motive-power to machinery took full
effect. The fluctuations of the cotton weaving industry and the
depression of wages, aggravated by the French wars and trade
restrictions, are illustrated by a petition of weavers (No. 9) and by
evidence before a committee on the Orders in Council (No. 10). The rest
of the extracts refer chiefly to the employment of children under the
new industrial conditions. The report of Dr. Perceval in 1796 (No. 6)
helped to produce the original Factory Act (See Pt. III, Section III,
No. 9). The evidence of Peel and Owen before the committee of 1816 is
given as the testimony of exceptional employers (No. 11). It supplements
the picture painted by children, parents and overseers before Sadler's
committee (No. 13). The Commission of 1842 (No. 14) supplies evidence of
the conditions under which women and children worked in the coal mines.
A brief description by a surgeon of the condition of Manchester in 1840
is added as giving some indication of the part played by housing
conditions in the Industrial Revolution (No. 15).</p>

Defoe, A Tour Through Great Britain, Vol. III, pp. 144-146, Ed. 1769</i>],
1724.</p>

<p>From Blackstone Edge to Halifax is eight miles; and all the way, except
from Sowerby to Halifax, is thus up hill and down; so that, I suppose,
we mounted up to the clouds, and descended to the water-level, about
eight times in that little part of the journey.</p>

<p>But now I must observe to you, that after we passed the second hill, and
were come down into the valley again; and so still the nearer we came to
Halifax, we found the houses thicker, and the villages greater in every
bottom; and not only so, but the sides of the hills, which were very
steep every way were spread with houses; for the land being divided into
small inclosures, from two acres to six or seven each, seldom more,
every three or four pieces of land had an house belonging to them.</p>

<p>In short, after we had mounted the third hill we found the country one
continued village, though every way mountainous, hardly an house
standing out of a speaking distance from another; and as the day cleared
up, we could see at every house a tenter, and on almost every tenter a
piece of cloth, kersie, or shalloon; which are the three articles of
this country's labour.</p>

<p>In the course of our road among the houses, we found at every one of
them a little rill or gutter of running water; if the house was above
the road, it came from it, and crossed the way to run to another; if the
house was below us, it crossed us from some other distant house above
it; and at every considerable house was a manufactory; which not being
able to be carried on without water, these little streams were so parted
and guided by gutters or pipes, that not one of the houses wanted its
necessary appendage of a rivulet.</p>

<p>Again, as the dyeing-houses, scouring-shops, and places where they use
this water, emit it tinged with the drugs of the dyeing vat, and with
the oil, the soap, the tallow, and other ingredients used by the
clothiers in dressing and scouring, etc., the lands through which it
passes, which otherwise would be exceeding barren, are enriched by it to
a degree beyond imagination.</p>

<p>Then, as every clothier must necessarily keep one horse, at least, to
fetch home his wool and his provisions from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span> market, to carry his
yarn to the spinners, his manufacture to the fulling-mill, and when
finished, to the market to be sold, and the like; so every one generally
keeps a cow or two for his family. By this means, the small pieces of
inclosed land about each house are occupied; and, by being thus fed, are
still farther improved from the dung of the cattle. As for corn, they
scarce sow enough to feed their poultry.</p>

<p>Such, it seems, has been the bounty of nature to this county, that two
things essential to life, and more particularly to the business followed
here, are found in it, and in such a situation as is not to be met with
in any part of England, if in the world beside; I mean coals, and
running water on the tops of the highest hills. I doubt not but there
are both springs and coals lower in these hills; but were they to fetch
them thence, it is probable the pits would be too full of water: it is
easy, however, to fetch them from the upper parts, the horses going
light up, and coming down loaden. This place, then, seems to have been
designed by providence for the very purposes to which it is now
allotted, for carrying on a manufacture, which can nowhere be so easily
supplied with the conveniences necessary for it. Nor is the industry of
the people wanting to second these advantages. Though we met few people
without doors, yet within we saw the houses full of lusty fellows, some
at the dye-vat, some at the loom, others dressing the cloths; the women
and children carding, or spinning; all employed from the youngest to the
oldest; scarce any thing above four years old, but its hands were
sufficient for its own support. Nor a beggar to be seen, nor an idle
person, except here and there in an alms-house, built for those that are
ancient, and past working. The people in general live long; they enjoy a
good air; and under such circumstances hard labour is naturally attended
with the blessing of health, if not riches.</p>

<p>From this account, you will easily imagine, that some of these remote
parts of the North are the most populous places of Great Britain, London
and its neighbourhood excepted.</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap"><a name="Defoes_Account_of_the_Wool_Trade_and_Woollen_Industries" id="Defoes_Account_of_the_Wool_Trade_and_Woollen_Industries"></a>Defoe's Account of the Wool Trade and Woollen Industries</span>
[<i>D. Defoe, The Complete English Tradesman, Ed. 1841, Vol. II, pp.
188-93</i>], <i>temp.</i> George II.</p>

<p>First, the wool itself, being taken from the sheep's back, either by the
shearer, the farmer, or by the fellmonger from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span> the skin, becomes a
subject of trade; and is either sold to the stapler, or wool merchant,
and by him to the manufacturer, or is carried by the farmer and
fellmonger, as is sometimes the case, to the particular counties where
it is consumed.</p>

<p>These staplers and wool dealers are scattered all over the kingdom, and
are a very important and considerable sort of tradesmen, being the first
tradesmen into whose hands the said wool comes for sale: the principal
towns in England where they are found to be in any numbers together, are
in London, or Southwark rather, being principally in Barnaby Street, and
the town of Blandford in Dorsetshire; there are also some in Norwich and
in Lincolnshire, and in Leicestershire a great many.</p>

<p>Stourbridge fair is famous for the great quantity of wool sold there,
and which goes beyond any other fairs or markets in all the north or
east parts of England.</p>

<p>But wherever the wool is carried, and by whomsoever it is sold, this of
course brings it to the first part of its manufacturing; and this
consists of two operations:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
1. Combing.                   <span style="margin-left: 10em;"> 2. Carding.</span>
</p>

<p>The combers are a particular set of people, and the combing a trade by
itself; the carding, on the other hand, is chiefly done by workmen hired
by the clothiers themselves; the combers buy the wool in the fleece or
in the pack, and when it is combed, put it on to the next operation on
their own account. The carding is generally done by hired servants, as
above; these operations hand on the wool to the next, which is common to
both, viz., the spinning.</p>

<p>But before it comes this length, it requires a prodigious number of
people, horses, carts or wagons, to carry it from place to place; for
the people of those countries where the wool is grown, or taken as
above, are not the people who spin it into yarn.</p>

<p>On the contrary, some whole counties and parts of counties are employed
in spinning, who see nothing of any manufacture among them, the mere
spinning only excepted.</p>

<p>Thus the weavers of Norwich and of the parts adjacent, and the weavers
of Spitalfields in London, send exceeding great quantities of wool into
remote counties to be spun, besides what they spin in both those
populous counties of Norfolk and Suffolk; particularly they employ
almost the whole counties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span> of Cambridge, Bedford, and Hertford; and
besides that, as if all this part of England was not sufficient for
them, they send a very great quantity of wool one hundred and fifty
miles by land carriage to the north, as far as Westmoreland, to be spun;
and the yarn is brought back in the same manner to London and to
Norwich.</p>

<p>This vast consumption of wool in Norfolk and Suffolk is supplied chiefly
out of Lincolnshire, a county famous for the large sheep bred up for the
supply of the London markets, as the western manufacturers are supplied
from Leicestershire; of which in its place.</p>

<p>Nor is all this sufficient still; but as if all England was not able to
spin sufficient to the manufacture, a very great quantity of yarn, ready
spun, is brought from Ireland, landed at Bristol, and brought from
thence by land carriage to London, and then to Norwich also.</p>

<p>The county of Essex, a large and exceedingly populous county, is chiefly
taken up with the great manufacture of bays and perpets; the consumption
of wool for this manufacture is chiefly bought of the staplers in
London; the sorting, oiling, combing, or otherwise preparing the wool,
is the work of the master manufacturer or bay maker; and the yarn is
generally spun in the same county, the extent of it being not less than
between fifty and sixty miles' square, and full of great and populous
towns, such as Colchester, Braintree, Coggeshall, Chelmsford,
Billericay, Bishop Stortford, Saffron Walden, Waltham, Romford, and
innumerable smaller but very populous villages, and, in a word, the
whole county full of people.</p>

<p>The western part of England, superior both in manufactures and in
numbers of people also, are not to be supplied either with wool or with
spinning, among themselves, notwithstanding two such articles in both,
as no other part of England can come up to by a great deal, viz.:</p>

<p>1. Notwithstanding the prodigious numbers of sheep fed upon those almost
boundless downs and plains in the counties of Dorset, Wilts, Gloucester,
Somerset, and Hampshire, where the multitudes, not of sheep only, but
even of flocks of sheep, are not to be reckoned up; insomuch that the
people of Dorchester say there are six hundred thousand sheep always
feeding within six miles round that one town.</p>

<p>2. Notwithstanding the large and most populous counties of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span> Wilts,
Somerset, Gloucester, and Devon, in which the manufacture being so
exceeding great, all the women inhabitants may be supposed to be
thoroughly employed in spinning the yarn for them, and in which counties
are, besides, the populous cities of Exeter, Salisbury, Wells, Bath,
Bristol, and Gloucester; I say besides these, the greatest towns, and
the greatest number of them that any other part of the whole kingdom of
Great Britain can show, some of which exceed even the great towns of
Leeds, Wakefield, Sheffield, etc., in the North; such as Taunton,
Devizes, Tiverton, Crediton, Bradford, Trowbridge, Westbury, Froome,
Stroud, Biddeford, Barnstaple, Dartmouth, Bridgewater, Mynhead, Poole,
Weymouth, Dorchester, Blandford, Wimbourn, Sherbourne, Cirencester,
Honiton, Warminster, Tewksbury, Tedbury, Malmsbury, and abundance of
others, too many to set down; all which I mention, because those who
pretend to have calculated the numbers of people employed in these four
counties assure me that there are not so few as a million of people
constantly employed there in spinning and weaving for the woollen
manufacture only; that besides the great cities, towns, and seaports,
mentioned above, there are not less than one hundred and twenty market
towns, six large cities, and fifteen hundred parishes, some of which are
exceeding full of people.</p>

<p>And yet, notwithstanding all this, such is the greatness of this
prodigious manufacture, that they are said to take yearly thirty
thousand packs of wool, and twenty-five thousand packs of yarn ready
spun from Ireland.</p>

<p>From hence, take a short view of the middle part of England: Leicester,
Northampton, and Warwick shires have a prodigious number of large sheep,
which, as is said of Lincolnshire, are bred for the London markets; the
wool, consequently, is of an exceeding long staple, and the fineness is
known also to be extraordinary.</p>

<p>This wool is brought every week, Tuesday and Friday, to the market at
Cirencester, on the edge of Gloucester and Wilts; the quantity is
supposed to be at least five hundred packs of wool per week.</p>

<p>Here it is bought by the woolcombers and carders of Tedbury, Malmsbury,
and the towns on all that side of Wilts and Gloucester, besides what the
clothiers themselves buy; these carry it out far and near among the poor
people of all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span> adjacent countries, for the spinning; and having made
the yarn, they supply that manufacture as far as Froome, Warminster, and
Taunton; and thus the west country is furnished.</p>

<p>The north requires another inspection; the rest of the Leicestershire
wool merchants, who do not bring their wool southward, carry it forward
to the north, to Wakefield, Leeds, and Halifax; here they mix it with,
and use it among the northern wool, which is not esteemed so fine.</p>

<p>Not forgetting, notwithstanding, that they have a great deal of very
fine wool, and of a good staple, from the wolds or downs in the East
Hiding of Yorkshire, and from the bishoprick of Durham, more especially
the banks of the Tees, where, for a long way, the grounds are rich, and
the sheep thought to be the largest in England.</p>

<p>Hither all the finest wool of those countries is brought; and the
coarser sort, and the Scots' wool, which comes into Halifax, Rochdale,
Bury, and the manufacturing towns of Lancashire, Westmoreland, and
Cumberland, are employed in the coarser manufactures of those countries,
such as kerseys, half-thicks, yarn stockings, duffields, rugs, Turkey
work, chairs, and many other useful things, which those countries abound
in.</p>


<p>3. <span class="smcap"><a name="Defoes_Account_of_the_Corn_Trade" id="Defoes_Account_of_the_Corn_Trade"></a>Defoe's Account of the Corn Trade</span> [<i>D. Defoe, The Complete
English Tradesman, Ed. 1841, Vol. II, pp. 177-182</i>], <i>temp.</i> George II.</p>

<p>As the corn trade is of such consequence to us, for the shipping off the
overplus, so it is a very considerable business in itself; the principal
people concerned in it, as a trade, are, though very numerous, yet but
of four denominations;&mdash;</p>




<table border="0" width='400' cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="names">
<tr><td align='left'>1. Cornfactors;</td><td align='left'>3. Maltsters;</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>2. Mealmen;</td><td align='left'>4. Carriers.</td></tr>
</table>




<p>1. Cornfactors; these, as corn is now become a considerable article of
trade, as well foreign as inland, are now exceeding numerous; and though
we had them at first only in London, yet now they are also in all the
great corn markets and ports where corn is exported through the whole
island of Britain; and in all those ports they generally correspond with
the corn factors in England.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span></p>

<p>Those in the country ride about among the farmers, and buy the corn even
in the barn before it is threshed; nay, sometimes they buy it in the
field standing, not only before it is reaped, but before it is ripe.
This subtle business is very profitable; for, by this means, cunningly
taking advantage of the farmers, by letting them have money before-hand,
which they, poor men, often want, they buy cheap when there is a
prospect of corn being dear; yet sometimes they are mistaken too, and
are caught in their own snare; but indeed, that is but seldom; and were
they famed for their honesty, as much as they generally are for their
understanding in business, they might boast of having a very shining
character.</p>

<p>2. Mealmen; these generally live either in London or within thirty miles
of it, that employment chiefly relating to the markets of London; they
formerly were the general buyers of corn, that is to say, wheat and rye,
in all the great markets about London, or within thirty or forty miles
of London, which corn they used to bring to the nearest mills they could
find to the market, and there have it ground, and then sell the meal to
the shopkeepers, called mealmen, in London.</p>

<p>But a few years past have given a new turn to this trade, for now the
bakers in London, and the parts adjacent, go to the markets themselves,
and have cut out the shopkeeping mealmen; so the bakers are the mealmen,
and sell the fine flour to private families, as the mealmen used to do.
And as the bakers have cut out the meal shops in London, so the millers
have cut out the mealmen in the country; and whereas they formerly only
ground the corn for the mealmen, they now scorn that trade, buy the
corn, and grind it for themselves; so the baker goes to the miller for
his meal, and the miller goes to the market for the corn.</p>

<p>It is true, this is an anticipation in trade, and is against a stated
wholesome rule of commerce, that trade ought to pass through as many
hands as it can; and that the circulation of trade, like that of the
blood, is the life of the commerce. But I am not directing to what
should be, but telling what is; it is certain the mealmen are, in a
manner, cut out of the trade, both in London and in the country, except
it be those country mealmen who send meal to London by barges, from all
the countries bordering on the Thames, or on any navigable river running
into the Thames west; and some about Chichester,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span> Arundel, and the coast
of Sussex and Hampshire, who send meal by sea; and these are a kind of
meal merchants, and have factors at London to sell it for them&mdash;either
at Queenhithe, the great meal-market of England, or at other smaller
markets.</p>

<p>By this change of the trade, the millers, especially in that part of
England which is near the Thames, who in former times were esteemed
people of a very mean employment, are now become men of vast business;
and it is not an uncommon thing to have mills upon some of the large
rivers near the town, which are let for three or four hundred pounds a
year rent.</p>

<p>3. Maltsters; these are now no longer farmers, and, as might be said,
working labouring people, as was formerly the case, when the public
expense of beer and ale, and the number of alehouses, was not so great,
but generally the most considerable farmers malted their own barley,
especially in the towns and counties, from whence they supplied London,
and almost every farmhouse of note.</p>

<p>As the demand for malt increased, those farmers found it for their
purpose to make more and larger quantities of malt, than the barley they
themselves sowed would supply; and so bought the barley at the smaller
farms about them; till at length the market for malt still increasing,
and the profits likewise encouraging, they sought far and near for
barley; and at this time the malting trade at Ware, Hertford, Royston,
Hitchin, and other towns on that side of Hertfordshire, fetch their
barley twenty, thirty, or forty miles; and all the barley they can get
out of the counties of Essex, Cambridge, Bedford, Huntingdon, and even
as far as Suffolk, is little enough to supply them; and the like it is
at all the malt-making towns upon the river of Thames, where the malt
trade is carried on for supply of London, such as Kingston, Chertsey,
Windsor, High Wycombe, Reading, Wallingford, Abingdon, Thame, Oxford,
and all the towns adjacent; and at Abingdon in particular, they have a
barley market, where you see every market-day four or five hundred carts
and wagons of barley to be sold at a time, standing in rows in the
market-place, besides the vast quantity carried directly to the
maltsters' houses.</p>

<p>The malt trade thus increasing, it soon came out of the hands of the
farmers; for either the farmers found so much business, and to so much
advantage, in the malting-trade, that they left off ploughing, and put
off their farms, sticking wholly to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span> malt; or other men, encouraged
by the apparent advantage of the malting-trade, set it up by itself, and
bought their barley, as is said above, of the farmers, when their malt
trade first increased; or both these together, which is most probable;
and thus malting became a trade by itself.</p>

<p>Again, though the farmers then generally left off malting in the manner
as above, yet they did not wholly throw themselves out of the profit of
the trade, but hired the making of their own malt; that is, to put out
their barley to the malthouses to be made on their account; and this
occasioned many men to erect malthouses, chiefly to make malt only for
other people, at so much per quarter, as they could agree; and at
intervals, if they wanted full employ, then they made it for themselves;
of these I shall say more presently.</p>

<p>Under the head of corn factors, I might have taken notice, that there
are many of those factors who sell no other grain than malt; and are, as
we may say, agents for the maltsters who stay in the country, and only
send up their goods; and assistants to those maltsters who come up
themselves.</p>

<p>The mentioning these factors again here, naturally brings me to observe
a new way of buying and selling of corn, as well as malt, which is
introduced by these factors; a practice greatly increased of late,
though it is an unlawful way of dealing, and many ways prejudicial to
the markets; and this is buying of corn by samples only. The case is
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>The farmer, who has perhaps twenty load of wheat in his barn, rubs out
only a few handfuls of it with his hand, and puts it into a little
money-bag; and with this sample, as it is called, in his pocket, away he
goes to market.</p>

<p>When he comes thither, he stands with his little bag in his hand, at a
particular place where such business is done, and thither the factors or
buyers come also; the factor looks on the sample, asks his price, bids,
and then buys; and that not a sack or a load, but the whole quantity;
and away they go together to the next inn, to adjust the bargain, the
manner of delivery, the payment, etc. Thus the whole barn, or stack, or
mow of corn, is sold at once; and not only so, but it is odds but the
factor deals with him ever after, by coming to his house; and so the
farmer troubles the market no more.</p>

<p>This kind of trade is chiefly carried on in those market-towns which are
at a small distance from London, or at least from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span> the river Thames;
such as Romford, Dartford, Grayes, Rochester, Maidstone, Chelmsford,
Malden, Colchester, Ipswich, and so down on both sides the river to the
North Foreland, and particularly at Margate and Whitstable, on one side;
and to the coast of Suffolk, and along the coast both ways beyond, and
likewise up the river. Also,</p>

<p>At these markets you may see, that, besides the market-house, where a
small quantity of corn perhaps is seen, the place mentioned above, where
the farmers and factors meet, is like a little exchange, where all the
rest of the business is transacted, and where a hundred times the
quantity of corn is bought and sold, as appears in sacks in the
market-house; it is thus, in particular, at Grayes, and at Dartford: and
though on a market-day there are very few wagons with corn to be seen in
the market, yet the street or market-place, nay, the towns and inns, are
thronged with farmers and samples on one hand, and with mealmen, London
bakers, millers, and cornfactors, and other buyers, on the other. The
rest of the week you see the wagons and carts continually coming all
night and all day, laden with corn of all sorts, to be delivered on
board the hoys, where the hoymen stand ready to receive it, and
generally to pay for it also: and thus a prodigious corn trade is
managed in the market, and little or nothing to be seen of it.</p>

English Tradesman, Ed. 1841, Vol. II, pp. 172-173</i>], <i>temp.</i> George II.</p>

<p>The Newcastle coals, brought by sea to London, are bought at the pit, or
at the steath or wharf, for under five shillings per chaldron; I suppose
I speak with the most; but when they come to London, are not delivered
to the consumers under from twenty-five to thirty shillings per
chaldron; and when they are a third time loaded on board the lighters in
the Thames, and carried through bridge, then loaded a fourth time into
the great west country barges, and carried up the river, perhaps to
Oxford or Abingdon, and thence loaded a fifth time in carts or wagons,
and carried perhaps ten or fifteen, or twenty miles to the last
consumer; by this time they are sometimes sold from forty-five to fifty
shillings per chaldron; so that the five shillings first cost, including
five shillings tax, is increased to five times the prime cost. And
because I have mentioned the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span> frequent loading and unloading the coals,
it is necessary to explain it here once for all, because it may give a
light into the nature of this river and coast commerce, not in this
thing only, but in many others; these loadings are thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. They are dug in the pit a vast depth in the ground, sometimes fifty,
sixty, to a hundred fathoms; and being loaded (for so the miners call
it) into a great basket or tub, are drawn up by a wheel and horse, or
horses, to the top of the shaft, or pit mouth, and there thrown out upon
the great heap, to lie ready against the ships come into the port to
demand them.</p>

<p>2. They are then loaded again into a great machine called a wagon; which
by the means of an artificial road, called a wagon-way, goes with the
help of but one horse, and carries two chaldron, or more, at a time, and
this, sometimes, three or four miles to the nearest river or water
carriage they come at; and there they are either thrown into, or from, a
great storehouse, called a steath, made so artificially, with one part
close to or hanging over the water, that the lighters or keels can come
close to, or under it, and the coals be at once shot out of the wagon
into the said lighters, which carry them to the ships, which I call the
first loading upon the water.</p>

<p class='center'><span class="smcap">The Tyranny of the Blackwel-Hall Factors.</span></p>

<p>The sufferings of the poor employed in working up Spanish wool, are not
owing to the unmercifulness of the clothiers, but the tyranny of
Blackwel-Hall factors; who though originally but the servants of the
makers, are now become their masters, and not only theirs, but the wool
merchants and drapers too.</p>

<p>Perhaps, sir, you may ask how it is possible that these men, who style
themselves but factors or agents, could find means to lord it as tyrants
over their employers? Why thus: they have managed it so, that the
merchant dare not sell his wool to the clothier, nor the clothier
presume to buy it of the merchant. On this grand point their whole power
is founded. To make this clear, sir, you are to understand, that in the
year<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span> 1695, the clothiers finding themselves in much the same
circumstances they are at present, by their credit given to the drapers
on one hand, and their being obliged to purchase wool of the factors, on
the other, applied in a body to parliament for relief, and an act was
accordingly past for restoring to them Blackwel-Hall for a market,
limiting the credit to be given for their goods, to six months; obliging
the factor to demand notes of hand of the draper, payable in that term,
for the use of the clothier, on penalty of forfeiting double the value
of the debt; and in case the draper refused to give such notes, so
demanded, fining him 20<i>s.</i></p>

<p>For a little while, this act had its desired effect; these notes were
immediately returned to the clothier, who carried them to market for
wool, etc., and by that means, made them answer in trade almost as well
as cash itself. The factors thus stripped of the most valuable part of
their business, immediately concerted such measures as rendered the
whole act ineffectual, and put it in their power to tyrannize over the
clothiers as much as ever. This was done, by tampering with those of the
trade, whose circumstances were most precarious, who induced by the
promise of a speedy sale for their goods, prior to those of any other
maker, were easily prevailed upon to forego the advantage of the notes
granted them by Parliament. This fatal precedent being once set, the
factors instantly exacted a like compliance from all the rest; and if
any refused not one piece of their cloth was sold. By which means, being
obliged to keep their workmen employed in the interval, their whole
stock, though ever so large, was exhausted; and the more stock they had,
the more it became their interest to truckle to their old oppressors,
and again take off their wool on what terms they pleased.</p>

<p>This important point carried, like true politicians, they resolved to
pursue their blow, and add some new acquisitions to what they possessed
before. Accordingly, they again allowed the drapers such unreasonable
credit, that it was impossible for the most substantial clothier to
carry on the trade, while the returns were so slow and precarious. On an
universal complaint therefore of this grievance, they graciously
condescended to insure the debt to be paid, twelve months after it was
contracted; but in return of so great a favour, insisted on two and a
half per cent. as a reward; and if any was rash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span> or stubborn enough to
disrelish or oppose this new imposition, he had the mortification to
wait six months longer for his money, that is to say, a year and a half
in all; which, together with the three months the cloth is in making,
and three that (one piece with another) it continues in the hall, before
it is sold off, make two years in the whole. Now let any one judge how
large a stock is absolutely necessary to carry on a trade, under all
these disadvantages, particularly when 'tis recollected, that the
clothier is obliged to pay his workmen ready money all this while,
whether his goods are vended or no; and that the modest factor always
insists on his being paid for his wool, with the first money he receives
for the cloth.</p>

<p>Neither is even this all. But if the clothier, hard drove by so vast and
so continued a charge, should be compelled, as too many are, to draw
upon the factor for money before 'tis due, according to their
calculation, one misfortune makes way for another; and he must pay an
extravagant premium for the advance, probably, of his own money. Nor are
you to wonder, sir, that these worthy gentlemen are so solicitous to
monopolise the whole market of Spanish wool; since, on a medium, they
get four pounds on every pack. Now a considerable clothier may be
supposed to work up 80 packs a year; which is in a manner a rent charge
of 320<i>l.</i> to the factor annually; for it is more than probable that
this very wool is purchased with the clothiers' cash; and while the
factor grows rich without any risk, and with very little trouble the
clothier is doubly excised, both for what he receives, and what is not
only withheld, but employed so manifestly to his prejudice.</p>

<p>'Tis farther to be observed, that as by far the greatest part of a
clothiers' stock must of necessity be lodged in the factors hands, if he
(the clothier) happens to break, or die insolvent (as in spite of a
whole life of toil and industry, many of them do) the factor immediately
seizes on the whole; it being (says he) a pledge for money advanced,
wool sold, etc., so that the rest of the creditors seldom receive a
farthing, while he, to whom the poor man's calamity is principally
owing, runs away with all.</p>

<p>Besides these capital grievances, there are several others, which though
inferior in degree, are, when added together, no small increase of the
load; such as the factors lumping the charges for warehouse-room in the
hall, porterage, pressing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span> packing, etc., every article of which ought
to be particular; as likewise sending out cloths to the drapers at the
expense of the clothier, not for sale; but one would be almost tempted
to think, to supply the shops with the paper and packthread they are
secured with; since they are returned stripp'd of both, tumbled from end
to end, exposed to all weather and accidents, and in such a condition as
renders it absolutely necessary to have them cleaned, pressed, and
packed anew. And all this, after they have been out of the hall six or
eight weeks; though the above quoted act of Parliament provides that
every cloth shall be reputed sold, after it hath been detained eight
days.</p>

<p>One would think, sir, I had already mentioned grievances enough, not
only to justify the clothier, but to excite the concern of the whole
people in their favour, and the aid of the legislature in their redress.
But there is yet another behind, which ought not to be omitted. It is
this. These worthy factors, not content with all these various methods
of oppression, to crown the whole, often set up people to act as master
clothiers, on their stock, during any little glut of business; and as it
is easy to imagine, give all the cloth so made, the preference of the
market, though perhaps in all respects, least deserving of it. Hence,
those that trade on their own bottoms, and employ the poor in good and
bad times alike, are liable to all the disadvantages of the one, with
little or no share in the benefits of the other. And hence, more people
are admitted into trade, than the trade can possibly maintain; which
opens a new door to the tumults and riots so lately felt.</p>

Factories</span> [<i>Report of Committee on State of Children in
Manufactories, 1816 (III), pp. 139-140</i>], 1796.</p>

<p class='center'>Resolutions for the consideration of the Manchester Board of Health, by
Dr. Perceval, January 25, 1796.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that the objects of the present institution
are to prevent the generation of diseases; to obviate the spreading of
them by contagion; and to shorten the duration of those which exist, by
affording the necessary aids and comforts to the sick. In the
prosecution of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span> interesting undertaking, the Board have had their
attention particularly directed to the large cotton factories
established in the town and neighbourhood of Manchester; and they feel
it a duty incumbent on them to lay before the public the result of their
inquiries:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. It appears that the children and others who work in the large
factories, are peculiarly disposed to be affected by the contagion of
fever, and that when such infection is received, it is rapidly
propagated, not only amongst those who are crowded together in the same
apartments, but in the families and neighbourhoods to which they belong.</p>

<p>2. The large factories are generally injurious to the constitution of
those employed in them, even where no particular diseases prevail, from
the close confinement which is enjoined, from the debilitating effects
of hot or impure air, and from the want of the active exercises which
nature points out as essential in childhood and youth, to invigorate the
system, and to fit our species for the employments and for the duties of
manhood.</p>

<p>3. The untimely labour of the night, and the protracted labour of the
day, with respect to children, not only tends to diminish future
expectations as to the general sum of life and industry, by impairing
the strength and destroying the vital stamina of the rising generation,
but it too often gives encouragement to idleness, extravagance and
profligacy in the parents, who, contrary to the order of nature, subsist
by the oppression of their offspring.</p>

<p>4. It appears that the children employed in factories are generally
debarred from all opportunities of education, and from moral or
religious instruction.</p>

<p>5. From the excellent regulations which subsist in several cotton
factories, it appears that many of these evils may, in a considerable
degree, be obviated; we are therefore warranted by experience, and are
assured we shall have the support of the liberal proprietors of these
factories, in proposing an application for Parliamentary aid (if other
methods appear not likely to effect the purpose), to establish a general
system of laws for the wise, humane, and equal government of all such
works.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span></p>

<p>Is there any regulation or limit as to price they<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> may give to the
coal-owners?</p>

<p>In August, September, and October, 1771, I found great irregularities in
the Coal Trade, particularly with respect to the measure. I communicated
my sentiments to two of the most respectable agents of the owners ...;
upon which it was agreed that a meeting should be had of the coal owners
belonging to Sunderland, to be convened by me, and the coal owners at
Newcastle, to be convened by a Mr. Gibson and Mr. Morrison, which was
done; and we had three or four meetings, and I was appointed
Secretary.... Since that time, according to the best enquiries I have
been able to make, the coal owners have had frequent meetings for the
purpose of stipulating the vends<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>; that is, that five of the
collieries of the best coals, viz., Walls End, Walker, Wellington,
Hebburn, and Heyton, are permitted to vend the greatest proportion, and
at the best price; after that there is a second class, which sells one
shilling per chaldron lower, being coals of an inferior quality, and
also less in proportion as to quantity; there is likewise a third class,
at a shilling less than the second, and who are allowed to sell a still
less proportion as to quantity.</p>

<p>By what means do you understand those vends have been limited? By the
meetings of the coal owners frequently for the purpose of ascertaining
the vends.</p>

<p>Was there any positive agreement for that purpose? That cannot be well
known, being contrary to Act of Parliament.</p>

<p class='center'>(<i>b</i>) 1830.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>The proprietors of the best coals are called upon to name the price at
which they intend to sell their coals for the succeeding twelve months;
according to this price, the remaining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span> proprietors fix their prices;
this being accomplished, each colliery is requested to send in a
statement of the different sorts of coals they raise, and the powers of
the colliery; that is, the quantity that each particular colliery could
raise at full work; and upon these statements the committee, assuming an
imaginary basis, fix the relative proportions, as to quantity, between
all the collieries, which proportions are observed, whatever quantity
the markets may demand. The committee then meet once a month, and
according to the probable demand of the ensuing month, they issue so
much per 1000 to the different collieries; that is, if they give me an
imaginary basis of 30,000 and my neighbour 20,000, according to the
quality of our coal and our power of raising them in the monthly
quantity; if they issue 100 to 1000, I raise and sell 3,000 during the
month, and my neighbour 2,000; but in fixing the relative quantities, if
we take 800,000 chaldrons as the probable demand of the different
markets for the year; if the markets should require more, an increased
quantity would be given out monthly, so as to raise the annual quantity
to meet that demand, were it double the original quantity.</p>

<p>What means have been resorted to in the north of England, with a view to
keep the price of coal at such a rate as should compensate the owners of
these collieries in which the expense of raising is the greatest?</p>

<p>We have entered into a regulation at different times, which regulation
is in existence now, and which has for its object to secure us a fair
uniform remunerating price, and enables us to sell our coals at the port
of shipment under our immediate inspection, instead of being driven by a
fighting trade, to become the carrier of our coals, and to sell them by
third persons in the markets to which they are consigned; thereby
trusting our interests to those over whom we have no direct control
whatever.</p>

<p>So that practically the real quantity to be sold is fixed with reference
to each colliery each month?</p>

<p>Yes. The basis originally fixed, is the proportion taken between all the
collieries?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span></p>

<p>It is merely an imaginary quantity to fix the relative proportions.</p>

<p>Has the scale of prices now in operation been varied materially from
that which was adopted when the regulation of the vend was last on?</p>

<p>I have already stated in my evidence that ours is a competition price,
that we endeavour to get the best price we can, which is a little below
what the consumer can get the same article for elsewhere. In the
regulation in 1828 we found we had fixed our prices too high; the
consequence was, it created an immediate influx of coals from Scotland,
Wales and Yorkshire, and more especially from Stockton; so that when the
coal-owners met together, to enter into another arrangement last year,
we were obliged to fix our prices a little lower.</p>

<p>Do you instruct this apprentice in the different branches of the trade?</p>

<p>As far as he has been capable I have done.</p>

<p>Will you enumerate the different branches of the trade which you
yourself learnt, and in which you instruct your apprentice?</p>

<p>I learnt to be a spinner before I went apprentice; my apprentice was
only eleven years old when I took him; when I went apprentice I was a
strong boy, and I was put to weaving first; I never was employed in
bobbin winding myself while I was apprentice; I had learned part of the
business with my father-in-law before I went; I knew how to wind bobbins
and to warp; after that I learned to weave; we had two apprentices, and
after I had been there a little while we used to spin and weave our
webs; while one was spinning the other was weaving.</p>

<p>Did you also learn to buy your own wool?</p>

<p>Yes; I had the prospect of being a master when I came out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span> of my time,
and therefore my master took care I should learn that.</p>

<p>Does that branch require great skill?</p>

<p>Yes, it does; I found myself very deficient when I was loose.</p>

<p>Different sorts of wool are applicable to different dyes and different
manufactures?</p>

<p>Yes; I was frequently obliged to resort to my master for information as
to the dyeing and buying wool.</p>

<p>Does it not require great skill to dye according to pattern, even when
you have bought wool?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Were you also instructed in that?</p>

<p>Yes; I kept an account all the time I was apprentice of the principal
part of the colours we dyed, and practised the dyeing: I always assisted
in dyeing; I was not kept constantly to weaving and spinning; my master
fitted me rather for a master than a journeyman.</p>

<p>And you instruct your apprentice in the same line?</p>

<p>Yes; we think it a scandal when an apprentice is loose if he is not fit

Geo. III, 1807, Feb. 26</i>], 1807.</p>

<p>A petition of the several Journeymen Cotton Weavers resident in the
counties of Lancaster, Chester, York, and Derby, was presented and read;
setting forth, That the petitioners suffer great hardships by the
reduction of their wages, and that whenever the demand for goods becomes
slack, many master manufacturers adopt the expedient of reducing wages,
thereby compelling the petitioners, in order to obtain a livelihood, to
manufacture greater quantities of goods at a time when they are
absolutely not wanted, and that great quantities of goods so
manufactured are sacrificed in the market at low prices, to the manifest
injury of the fair dealer, and the great oppression of the petitioners,
who are reduced one half of the wages they are justly entitled to, and
in many cases, are not able to earn more than nine shillings per week:
And therefore praying, That leave may be given to bring in a bill to
regulate, from time to time, the wages of the petitioners.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'><i>Evidence of James Kay</i> (<i>cotton and woollen manufacturer, of Bury</i>).</p>

<p>What used to be the price of cotton per piece in 1807?&mdash;I took out the
manufacturing prices for three years before 1807, and four years since.
Those are minutes from your own books?&mdash;Yes, in May, 1805, for the
quality goods called Blackburn supers we gave six shillings; in May,
1806, we gave the same; in May, 1807, we gave the same; in November,
1807, we dropped them to 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; in December, 1807, to 5<i>s.</i>; in
January 1808 to 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; in May 1808 they were at 4<i>s.</i>; it was at
the time they were very much distressed, and rioting. In May, 1809, we
gave 4<i>s.</i>, in March, 1810, we, gave 7<i>s.</i>; in April, 6<i>s</i>.; and in May
the same. In May, 1811, we again gave 4<i>s.</i>; and at the present time we
give 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class='center'><i>Evidence of Jeremiah Bury</i> (<i>cotton manufacturer of Stockport</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25em;"><i>Friday, May 15, 1812.</i></p>

<p>What might a man make at weaving, in the year 1810?&mdash;A man weaving plain
work, in the year 1810, might make probably from 12<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> a
week.</p>

<p>At plain work now what may a person earn?&mdash;The same man now would not
make more than ten or twelve shillings.</p>

<p>What might a man in full employment, in 1810, make in spinning?&mdash; ... I
apprehend that a man might make from fifteen to twenty-five shillings a
week in spinning.</p>

<p>What will the same man make now?&mdash;I think a man now might make from
thirteen or fourteen to eighteen shillings.</p>

<p>Do you ever recollect so great distress as there is at present?&mdash;Never;
I have known the trade these thirty years, but I never knew anything
like it.</p>

<p>Your manufactures went to the Continent pretty extensively till the year
1807?&mdash;Yes, we sold to the merchants who sent to the Continent.</p>

<p>Can you tell what interrupted that trade?&mdash;We had no further trade when
the Continent was shut up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span></p>

<p>To what is the want of trade owing?&mdash;The want of market for our goods.</p>

<p>To what is the want of market owing?&mdash;It is impossible for me to say,
but I believe if we had an opening in America, we should have sufficient
market for our goods; when we lost the Continental trade we had America
to depend upon, now we have lost America we have no regular markets to
depend upon.</p>

[<i>Report of Committee on Children in Manufactories</i>, 1816 (<i>III</i>), <i>pp</i>.
89 <i>and</i> 132-133], 1816.</p>
<p class='center'><i>Mr. Robert Owen, again called in, and examined.</i></p>

<p>Have you anything to add to your evidence of yesterday?&mdash;Some questions
were put to me yesterday respecting the early age at which children are
employed at Stockport; I knew I had made a memorandum at the time, but I
could not then put my hand upon it; I have since found it; and I can now
reply to the questions regarding those cases. Mr. George Oughton,
secretary to the Sunday school in Stockport, informed me about a
fortnight ago, in the presence of an individual, who will probably be
here in the course of the morning, that he knows a little girl of the
name of Hannah Downham, who was employed in a mill at Stockport at the
age of four. Mr. Turner, treasurer to the Sunday school, knows a boy
that was employed in a mill at Stockport when he was only three years
old. Mr. Turner and Mr. Oughton, if they were sent for would, I have no
doubt, state these cases before the Committee.</p>

<p>They were mentioned to you as a rare instance?&mdash;They were mentioned to
me in the midst of a very numerous assembly of very respectable people;
I inquired of them whether they knew, as they were surrounded with, I
believe, two or three thousand children at the time, what was the age at
which children were generally admitted into cotton mills; their answer
was, Some at five, many at six, and a greater number at seven. I have
also received very important information from a very respectable
individual at Manchester, relative to the age at which children are
employed, the hours they are kept to work, and a variety of other
particulars from very authentic sources.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span></p>

<p>Name those sources?&mdash;Mr. Nathaniel Gould and Mr. George Gould.</p>

<p>Does the information you propose to give come from the manufactory to
which it relates?&mdash;No manufacturer would give information against
himself.</p>

<p>State what you know relative to the number of hours which children and
others are employed in their attendance on mills and
manufactories?&mdash;About a fortnight ago I was in Leeds; and in
conversation with Mr. Gott, whose name is well-known to many gentlemen
in this room, he stated to me that it was a common practice, when the
woollen trade was going on well, to work sixteen hours in the day: I was
also informed by Mr. Marshall, who is another principal, and considered
a highly respectable manufacturer in Leeds, that it was a common
practice to work at flax-mills there sixteen hours a day whenever the
trade went well: I was also informed by Mr. Gott, that when the Bill,
generally known by the name of Sir Robert Peel's Bill, was brought in
last session of Parliament, the night-work at Leeds was put an end to.
In Stockport, on Sunday fortnight, I saw a number of small children
going to the church; they appeared to me to be going from a Sunday
school; the master was with them; I stopped the master, and asked him
what he knew of the circumstances of the manufacturers in Stockport; he
said he knew a great deal, because he himself had formerly, for many
years, been a spinner in those mills; his name is Robert Mayor, of the
National School in Stockport; he stated that he was willing to make oath
that mills in Stockport, within the last twelve months, had been worked
from three and four o'clock in the morning until nine at night, that he
himself has frequently worked those hours.</p>


<p class='center'><i>Sir Robert Peel, Bart</i>.</p>

<p>The house in which I have a concern gave employment at one time to near
one thousand children of this description. Having other pursuits, it was
not often in my power to visit the factories, but whenever such visits
were made, I was struck with the uniform appearance of bad health, and,
in many cases, stinted growth of the children; the hours of labour were
regulated by the interest of the overseer, whose remuneration depending
on the quantity of the work done,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span> he was often induced to make the poor
children work excessive hours, and to stop their complaints by trifling
bribes. Finding our own factories under such management, and learning
that the like practices prevailed in other parts of the kingdom where
similar machinery was in use, the children being much over-worked, and
often little or no regard paid to cleanliness and ventilation in the
buildings; having the assistance of Dr. Percival and other eminent
medical gentlemen of Manchester, together with some distinguished
characters both in and out of Parliament, I brought in a Bill in the
Forty-second year of the King, for the regulation of factories
containing such parish apprentices. The hours of work allowed by that
Bill being fewer in number than those formerly practised, a visible
improvement in the health and general appearance of the children soon
became evident, and since the complete operation of the Act contagious
disorders have rarely occurred.</p>

<p>Diffident of my own abilities to originate legislative measures, I
should have contented myself with the one alluded to, had I not
perceived, that, owing to the present use of steam power in factories,
the Forty-second of the King is likely to become a dead letter. Large
buildings are now erected, not only as formerly on the banks of streams,
but in the midst of populous towns, and instead of parish apprentices
being sought after, the children of the surrounding poor are preferred,
whose masters being free from the operation of the former Act of
Parliament are subjected to no limitation of time in the prosecution of
their business, though children are frequently admitted there to work
thirteen to fourteen hours per day, at the tender age of seven years,
and even in some cases still younger. I need not ask the Committee to
give an opinion of the consequence of such a baneful practice upon the
health and well-being of these little creatures, particularly after
having heard the sentiments of those eminent medical men who have been
examined before us; but I most anxiously press upon the Committee, that
unless some parliamentary interference takes place, the benefits of the
Apprentice Bill will soon be entirely lost, the practice of employing
parish apprentices will cease, their places will be wholly supplied by
other children, between whom and their masters no permanent contract is
likely to exist, and for whose good treatment there will not be the
slightest security. Such indiscriminate and unlimited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span> employment of the
poor, consisting of a great proportion of the inhabitants of trading
districts, will be attended with effects to the rising generation so
serious and alarming, that I cannot contemplate them without dismay, and
thus that great effort of British ingenuity, whereby the machinery of
our manufactures has been brought to such perfection, instead of being a
blessing to the nation, will be converted into the bitterest curse.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, if parish apprentices were formerly deemed worthy of the care
of Parliament, I trust you will not withhold from the unprotected
children of the present day an equal measure of mercy, as they have no
masters who are obliged to support them in sickness or during
unfavourable periods of trade.</p>

Power-Loom Weaving</span> [<i>William Radcliffe, The Origin of Power-Loom
Weaving</i>, 1828, <i>pp.</i> 9-10, <i>etc.</i>], <i>c.</i> 1785-1807.</p>

<p>The principal estates being gone from the family, my father resorted to
the common but never-failing resource for subsistence at that period,
viz., the loom for men, and the cards and hand-wheel for women and boys.
He married a spinster (in my etymology of the word) and my mother taught
me (while too young to weave) to earn my bread by carding and spinning
cotton, winding linen or cotton weft for my father and elder brothers at
the loom, until I became of sufficient age and strength for my father to
put me into a loom. After the practical experience of a few years, any
young man who was industrious and careful, might then, from his earnings
as a weaver, lay by sufficient to set him up as a manufacturer, and
though but few of the great body of weavers had the courage to embark in
the attempt, I was one of the few. Availing myself of the improvements
that came out while I was in my teens, by the time I was married (at the
age of 24, in 1785), with my little savings, and a practical knowledge
of every process from the cotton-bag to the piece of cloth, such as
carding by hand or by the engine, spinning by the hand-wheel or jenny,
winding, warping, sizing, looming the web, and weaving either by hand or
fly-shuttle, I was ready to commence business for myself; and by the
year 1789, I was well estab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>lished, and employed many hands both in
spinning and weaving, as a master manufacturer.</p>

<p>From 1789 to 1794, my chief business was the sale of muslin warps, sized
and ready for the loom (being the first who sold cotton twist in that
state, chiefly to Mr. Oldknow, the father of the muslin trade in our
country). Some warps I sent to Glasgow and Paisley. I also manufactured
a few muslins myself, and had a warehouse in Manchester for my general
business.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At Midsummer, 1801, on taking<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> stock very accurately we<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> found
we had upwards of &pound;11,000 in our concern; I had also a landed estate in
Mellor, in which was comprehended Podmore, where my father was born,
with a rent roll, and good tenants of upwards of &pound;350 per annum, charged
with about &pound;1,800 on mortgage. Mr. Ross's father was a merchant and
magistrate in Montrose, and rich, and, my partner being an only son,
could at any time lend us a few thousands, which he afterwards did to
the amount of &pound;6,000, including the &pound;2,500 paid down on the formation of
our partnership. With this real capital&mdash;an unlimited credit (&pound;5,000
with our bankers amongst the rest), an excellent trade, and every
prospect of its continuing so for a time, we came to the conclusion of
purchasing the premises in the Hillgate, from Mr. Oldknow and Mr.
Arkwright, then standing empty, which I never should have thought of for
a moment, but from what had passed at the Castle Inn, for the sole
purpose of filling them with looms, etc., on some new plan, and just so
much spinning machinery as would supply the looms with weft. But beyond
the common warping, sizing, weaving, etc., all was a chaos before me;
yet so confident was I, that with such assistance as I could call in, we
should succeed, that before I began I laid a trifling wager with my
partner, that in two years from the time I commenced, I produced 500
pieces of 7-8ths and 9-8ths printing cambrics, all wove in the building
in one week by some new process, which I won easily. And as the price
for weaving alone when we began was 17<i>s.</i> per piece, and had never been
below 16<i>s.</i> at any time, we thought we were justified in what we were
doing, even if little improvement could be found. And if the goods made
abroad from the annually increasing export of twist,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span> and their
prohibitions of our goods in consequence, had not gradually reduced this
price of weaving from 17<i>s.</i> (with a profit of 10 to 20 per cent. to the
master), to 4<i>s.</i> to the weaver (and no profit to the master!), we
should have been handsomely rewarded by our trade. But to return from
this digression, we concluded our contract about Michaelmas with Messrs.
Oldknow and Arkwright, for the premises above mentioned; and I brought
my family to Stockport in the latter end of December, 1801. I must here
observe that we had at that time a large concern in Mellor, that with
its various branches for putting out work, employing upwards of 1000
weavers, widely spread over the borders of three counties, in a vast
variety of plain and fancy goods, all of which had been raised (like a
gathering snowball) from a single spindle, or single loom by myself, and
was then upon such a system as apparently might go on without my
personal attention.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I shut myself up (as it were) in the mill on the 2nd January, 1802,<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>
and with joiners, turners, filers, etc., etc., set to work; my first
step was some looms in the common way in every respect, which I knew
would produce the cloth so much wanted, and in some degree cover our
weekly expenses.</p>

<p>Before the end of the month I began to divide the labour of the weavers,
employing one room to dress the whole web, in a small frame for the
purpose, ready for the looms in another room, so that the young weaver
had nothing to learn but to weave; and we found this a great
improvement, for besides the advantage of learning a young weaver in a
few days, we found that by weaving the web as it were back again, the
weft was driven up by the reed the way the brushes had laid the fibres
down with the paste, so that we could make good cloth in the upper rooms
with the dressed yarn quite dry, which could not be done in the old way
of dressing, when the weft was drove up against the points of the
fibres, which shewed us the reason why all weavers are obliged to work
in damp cellars, and must weave up their dressing, about a yard long,
before the yarn becomes dry, or it spoils.</p>

<p>This accomplished, I told my men I must have some motion attached to
either traddles or the lathe, by machinery, that would take up the cloth
as it was wove, so that the shed might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span> always be of the same
dimensions, and of course the blow of the lathe always moving the same
distance, would make the cloth more even than could possibly be done in
the old way, except by very skilful and careful weavers.</p>

<p>This motion to the loom being at length accomplished to our
satisfaction, I set Johnson to plan for the warping and dressing,
suggesting several ideas myself. His uncommon genius led him to propose
many things to me, but I pointed out objections to them all, and set him
to work again. His mind was so teased with difficulties, that he began
to relieve it by drinking for several days together (to which he was too
much addicted) but for this I never upbraided him, or deducted his wages
for the time, knowing that we were approaching our object; at length we
brought out the present plan, only that the undressed yarn was all on
one side, and the brush to be applied was first by hand, then by a
cylinder, and lastly the crank motion.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The partnership being thus dissolved,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> I proceeded in my business
with a double prospect of success; first, by the real business I was
doing weekly, of 6 to 700 pieces per week, of printing cambrics, mostly
woven in the factory, and the other part in weaving-families in the
neighbourhood, on the small looms I had furnished to them, delivering
them dressed warps on the beam, and pin-cops for the weft. This system
had now become practicable, and was so greatly approved of by the
weavers, that, had I weathered the calm, which soon after came upon my
credit, I might, in a short time, have had all my looms in the dwellings
of the operative weavers on the plan I had been driving at from the
first, and from the superior advantage of machine dressing. The evenness
produced by this mode of preparation, and the working in my loom, not
only rendered these goods of ready sale, but gave me a weekly profit of
90<i>l.</i> to 100<i>l.</i>, which, along with the second branch of income that
formed my double prospect, viz., the premiums of licenses under patent
rights beginning to pour in from the first houses in the trade, to the
amount of 1,500<i>l.</i>, in the eight months from the first of July, 1806,
to March, 1807, when my vessel became quite becalmed.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the year 1770,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> the land in our township was occupied by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span> between
fifty to sixty farmers; rents, to the best of my recollection, did not
exceed 10<i>s.</i> per statute acre, and out of these fifty or sixty farmers,
there were only six or seven who raised their rents directly from the
produce of their farms; all the rest got their rent partly in some
branch of trade, such as spinning and weaving woollen, linen, or cotton.
The cottagers were employed entirely in this manner, except for a few
weeks in the harvest. Being one of those cottagers, and intimately
acquainted with all the rest, as well as every farmer, I am the better
able to relate particularly how the change from the old system of
hand-labour to the new one of machinery operated in raising the price of
land in the subdivision I am speaking of. Cottage rents at that time,
with convenient loomshop and a small garden attached, were from one and
a half to two guineas per annum. The father of a family would earn from
eight shillings to half a guinea at his loom, and his sons, if he had
one, two, or three alongside of him, six or eight shillings each per
week; but the great sheet anchor of all cottages and small farms was the
labour attached to the hand-wheel, and when it is considered that it
required six to eight hands to prepare and spin yarn, of any of the
three materials I have mentioned, sufficient for the consumption of one
weaver,&mdash;this shews clearly the inexhaustible source there was for
labour for every person from the age of seven to eighty years (who
retained their sight and could move their hands) to earn their bread,
say one to three shillings per week, without going to the parish.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>From the year 1770 to 1788<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> a complete change had gradually been
effected in the spinning of yarns. That of wool had disappeared
altogether, and that of linen was also nearly gone; cotton, cotton,
cotton, was become the almost universal material for employment. The
hand-wheels, with the exception of one establishment, were all thrown
into lumber-rooms, the yarn was all spun on common jennies, the carding
for all numbers, up to 40 hanks in the pound, was done on carding
engines; but the finer numbers of 60 to 80 were still carded by hand, it
being a general opinion at that time that machine-carding would never
answer for fine numbers. In weaving no great alteration had taken place
during these eighteen years, save the introduction of the fly-shuttle, a
change in the woollen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span> looms to fustians and calico, and the linen
nearly gone, except the few fabrics in which there was a mixture of
cotton. To the best of my recollection there was no increase of looms
during this period,&mdash;but rather a decrease.</p>

<p>I shall confine myself to the families in my own neighbourhood.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
These families, up to the time I have been speaking of, whether as
cottagers or small farmers, had supported themselves by the different
occupations I have mentioned in spinning and manufacturing, as their
progenitors from the earliest institutions of society had done before
them. But the mule-twist now coming into vogue, for the warp, as well as
weft, added to the water-twist and common jenny yarns, with an
increasing demand for every fabric the loom could produce, put all hands
in request of every age and description. The fabrics made from wool or
linen vanished, while the old loomshops being insufficient, every
lumber-room, even old barns, cart-houses, and outbuildings of any
description were repaired, windows broke through the old blank walls,
and all fitted up for loomshops. This source of making room being at
length exhausted, new weavers' cottages with loomshops rose up in every
direction; all immediately filled, and when in full work the weekly
circulation of money, as the price of labour only, rose to five times
the amount ever before experienced in this subdivision, every family
bringing home weekly 40, 60, 80, 100, or even 120 shillings per week!!!</p>

<p>5051. Was any of that time taken up in cleaning the machinery?</p>

<p>They generally had to do what they call dry down; sometimes this took
the whole of the time at breakfast or drinking, and they were to get
their dinner or breakfast as they could; if not, it was brought home.</p>

<p>5054. Had you not great difficulty in awakening your children to this
excessive labour?</p>

<p>Yes, in the early time we had them to take up asleep and shake them,
when we got them on the floor to dress them, before we could get them
off to their work; but not so in the common hours.</p>

<p>5056. Supposing they had been a little too late, what would have been
the consequence during the long hours?</p>

<p>They were quartered in the longest hours, the same as in the shortest
time.</p>

<p>5057. What do you mean by quartering?</p>

<p>A quarter was taken off.</p>

<p>5058. If they had been how much too late?</p>

<p>Five minutes.</p>

<p>5059. What was the length of time they could be in bed during those long
hours?</p>

<p>It was near 11 o'clock before we could get them into bed after getting a
little victuals, and then at morning my mistress used to stop up all
night, for fear that we could not get them ready for the time; sometimes
we have gone to bed, and one of us generally awoke.</p>

<p>5060. What time did you get them up in the morning?</p>

<p>In general me or my mistress got up at 2 o'clock to dress them.</p>

<p>5061. So that they had not above four hours' sleep at this time?</p>

<p>No, they had not.</p>

<p>5062. For how long together was it?</p>

<p>About six weeks it held; it was only done when the throng was very much
on; it was not often that.</p>

<p>5063. The common hours of labour were from 6 in the morning till
half-past eight at night?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>5064. With the same intervals for food?</p>

<p>Yes, just the same.</p>

<p>5065. Were the children excessively fatigued by this labour?</p>

<p>Many times; we have cried often when we have given them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span> the little
victualling we had to give them; we had to shake them, and they have
fallen to sleep with the victuals in their mouths many a time.</p>

<p>5066. Had any of them any accident in consequence of this labour?</p>

<p>Yes, my eldest daughter when she went first there; she had been about
five weeks, and used to fettle the frames when they were running, and my
eldest girl agreed with one of the others to fettle hers that time, that
she would do her work; while she was learning more about the work, the
overlooker came by and said, "Ann, what are you doing there?" she said,
"I am doing it for my companion, in order that I may know more about
it," he said, "Let go, drop it this minute," and the cog caught her
forefinger nail, and screwed it off below the knuckle, and she was five
weeks in Leeds Infirmary.</p>

<p>5067. Has she lost that finger?</p>

<p>It is cut off at the second joint.</p>

<p>5068. Were her wages paid during that time?</p>

<p>As soon as the accident happened the wages were totally stopped; indeed,
I did not know which way to get her cured, and I do not know how it
would have been cured but for the Infirmary.</p>

<p>5069. Were the wages stopped at the half-day?</p>

<p>She was stopped a quarter of a day; it was done about four o'clock.</p>

<p>5072. Did this excessive term of labour occasion much cruelty also?</p>

<p>Yes, with being so very much fatigued the strap was very frequently
used.</p>

<p>5073. Have any of your children been strapped?</p>

<p>Yes, every one; the eldest daughter; I was up in Lancashire a fortnight,
and when I got home I saw her shoulders, and I said, "Ann, what is the
matter?" she said, "The overlooker has strapped me; but," she said, "do
not go to the overlooker, for if you do we shall lose our work "; I said
I would not if she would tell me the truth as to what caused it. "Well,"
she said, "I will tell you, father." She says, "I was fettling the
waste, and the girl I had learning had got so perfect she could keep the
side up till I could fettle the waste; the overlooker came round, and
said, "What are you doing?" I said, "I am fettling while the other girl
keeps the upper end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span> up"; he said, "Drop it this minute;" she said, "No,
I must go on with this"; and because she did not do it, he took a strap,
and beat her between the shoulders. My wife was out at the time, and
when she came in she said her back was beat nearly to a jelly; and the
rest of the girls encouraged her to go to Mrs. Varley, and she went to
her, and she rubbed it with a part of a glass of rum, and gave her an
old silk handkerchief to cover the place with till it got well."</p>

<p>5080. What was the wages in the short hours?</p>

<p>Three shillings a week each.</p>

<p>5081. When they wrought those very long hours what did they get?</p>

<p>Three shillings and sevenpence halfpenny.</p>

<p>5082. For all that additional labour they had only 7&frac12;<i>d.</i> a week
additional?</p>

<p>No more.</p>

<p>5083. Could you dispose of their wages, when they had received them, as
you wished: did you understand that?</p>

<p>They never said anything to me; but the children have said, "If we do
not bring some little from the shop I am afraid we shall lose our work."
And sometimes they used to bring a bit of sugar or some little oddment,
generally of their own head.</p>

<p>5084. That is, they were expected to lay out part of their wages under
the truck system?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>5086. Had your children any opportunity of sitting during those long
days of labour?</p>

<p>No; they were in general, whether there was work for them to do or not,
to move backwards and forwards till something came to their hands.</p>

<p>5118. At the time they worked those long hours, would it have been in
their power to work a shorter number of hours, taking the 3<i>s.</i>?</p>

<p>They must either go on at the long hours, or else be turned off.</p>

<p>5484. Have you had any children, yourself, working at these mills?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>5488. What sort of mill did she go to?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span></p>

<p>To a worsted manufactory; but it so happened with her that her
stepmother dying, I took her away to manage the affairs of my house; she
was very young to be sure, but she did what I had to do, except what I
hired out, and she is very healthy and strong; but with regard to my
boy, Edwin, he was a proverb for being active and straight before he
went; there is a portion of ground of considerable extent, opposite to a
building in our neighbourhood, and that boy would run seven times round
that piece of ground, and come in without being much fatigued; but when
he had gone to the mill some time, perhaps about three years, he began
to be weak in his knees; and it went on to that degree, that he could
scarcely walk; I had three steps up into my house, and I have seen that
boy get hold of the sides of the door to assist his getting up into the
house; many a one advised me to take him away; they said he would be
ruined, and made quite a cripple; but I was a poor man, and could not
afford to take him away, having a large family, six children, under my
care; they are not all mine, but I have to act as a father to them; he
still continued to go, but during the last six or seven months the
factory has been short of work; they spin for commission; and it has so
happened that they have worked less hours since last November than they
formerly did, not being able to obtain so much work; and he is very much
improved in that time with regard to the strength of his knees, and it
has been observed by the neighbours that he grows a little, but he is
bent in one knee.</p>

<p>5492. Have you had any other children on whom this labour has had a
similar effect?</p>

<p>Yes, I have a daughter Barbara; she went to the mill between 7 and 8
years of age; she was straight then, but, however, a few years back,
about three years since, she fell weak and lame in one of her knees, and
she was off her work in consequence; but, however, in a few weeks she
got a little recovered and went to the mill again, and she has continued
to go there ever since, and she has got very much bow-legged, the legs
are bent outwards.</p>

<p>5129. What time did you begin to work at a factory?</p>

<p>When I was six years old.</p>

<p>5130. At whose factory did you work?</p>

<p>Mr. Busk's.</p>

<p>5131. What kind of mill is it?</p>

<p>Flax-mill.</p>

<p>5132. What was your business in that mill?</p>

<p>I was a little doffer.</p>

<p>5133. What were your hours of labour in that mill?</p>

<p>From 5 in the morning till 9 at night, when they were thronged.</p>

<p>5134. For how long a time together have you worked that excessive length
of time?</p>

<p>For about half a year.</p>

<p>5214. You are considerably deformed in your person in consequence of
this labour?</p>

<p>Yes, I am.</p>

<p>5215. At what time did it come on?</p>

<p>I was about 13 years old when it began coming, and it has got worse
since; it is five years since my mother died, and my mother was never
able to get me a pair of good stays to hold me up, and when my mother
died I had to do for myself, and got me a pair.</p>

<p>5216. Were you perfectly straight and healthy before you worked at a
mill?</p>

<p>Yes, I was as straight a little girl as ever went up and down town.</p>

<p>5217. Were you straight till you were 13?</p>

<p>Yes, I was.</p>

<p>5218. Have you been attended to by any medical gentleman at Leeds or the
neighbourhood?</p>

<p>Yes, I have been under Mr. Hares.</p>

<p>5219. To what did he attribute it?</p>

<p>He said it was owing to hard labour, and working in the factories.</p>

limbs of the children so employed?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, that is my opinion; I took an examination of those that were

<p>8095. In which of Mr. Boyack's mills are you employed?</p>

<p>In a tow-mill.</p>

<p>8097. The New Ward Mill, is it?</p>

<p>Yes; there are fifty hands in the room altogether, old and young; and I
found that out of that fifty there were nine who had entered the mill
before they were nine years of age, who are now above thirteen years of
age.</p>

<p>8098. Having been at that employment then, four years?</p>

<p>Yes; and out of those nine, there were six who were splayfooted, and
three who were not; the three who were not splayfooted were worse upon
their legs than those who were; and one was most remarkably bow-legged;
she informed me she was perfectly straight before she entered the mills.</p>

<p>8099. What was that girl's name?</p>

<p>Margaret Webster.</p>

<p>8100. You say she was remarkably bow-legged, was it very observable?</p>

<p>Very observable; I can hardly describe the woman's deformity, from the
way in which she walks; but I have passed by, and thought that I was far
from her, and have got on her shins as I was going past her.</p>

<p>8103. Have you made any other examination?</p>

<p>I have examined those who had not entered the mills till after twelve
years of age, and found that out of fifty there were fourteen of this
class; two of them were splayfooted, and one with her ankle a little
wrong; the others were all perfectly straight.</p>

Employment Commission, Mines</i>, 1842 (<i>XV</i>), <i>p.</i> 24, <i>etc.</i>], 1842.</p>

<p>Sex: Employment of Girls and Women in Coal Mines. Districts in which
Girls and Women are Employed Underground.</p>

<p>119. In England, exclusive of Wales, it is only in some of the colliery
districts of Yorkshire and Lancashire that female children of tender age
and young and adult women are allowed to descend into the coal mines and
regularly to perform the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span> same kinds of underground work, and to work
for the same numbers of hours, as boys and men; but in the East of
Scotland their employment in the pits is general; and in South Wales it
is not uncommon.</p>

<p>120. West Riding of Yorkshire: Southern Part.&mdash;In many of the collieries
in this district, as far as relates to the underground employment, there
is no distinction of sex, but the labour is distributed indifferently
among both sexes, excepting that it is comparatively rare for the women
to hew or get the coals, although there are numerous instances in which
they regularly perform even this work. In great numbers of the coal-pits
in this district the men work in a state of perfect nakedness, and are
in this state assisted in their labour by females of all ages, from
girls of six years old to women of twenty-one, these females being
themselves quite naked down to the waist.</p>

<p>121. "Girls," says the Sub-Commissioner, "regularly perform all the
various offices of trapping, hurrying, filling, riddling, tipping, and
occasionally getting, just as they are performed by boys. One of the
most disgusting sights I have ever seen was that of young females,
dressed like boys in trousers, crawling on all fours, with belts round
their waists and chains passing between their legs, at day pits at
Hunshelf Bank, and in many small pits near Holmfrith and New Mills: it
exists also in several other places. I visited the Hunshelf Colliery on
the 18th of January: it is a day pit; that is there is no shaft or
descent; the gate or entrance is at the side of a bank, and nearly
horizontal. The gate was not more than a yard high, and in some places
not above two feet. When I arrived at the board or workings of the pit I
found at one of the side-boards down a narrow passage a girl of fourteen
years of age, in boy's clothes, picking down the coal with the regular
pick used by the men. She was half sitting, half lying, at her work, and
said she found it tired her very much, and "of course she didn't like
it." The place where she was at work was not two feet high. Further on
were men at work lying on their sides and getting. No less than six
girls out of eighteen men and children are employed in this pit. Whilst
I was in the pit the Rev. Mr. Bruce, of Wadsley, and the Rev. Mr.
Nelson, of Rotherham, who accompanied me, and remained outside, saw
another girl of ten years of age, also dressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span> in boy's clothes, who
was employed in hurrying, and these gentlemen saw her at work. She was a
nice-looking little child, but of course as black as a tinker, and with
a little necklace round her throat."</p>

<p class='center'><i>Conclusions.</i><a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>From the whole of the evidence which has been collected, and of which we
have thus endeavoured to give a digest, we find&mdash;</p>

<p>In regard to Coal Mines&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That instances occur in which children are taken into these mines to
work as early as four years of age, sometimes at five, and between five
and six, not unfrequently between six and seven, and often from seven to
eight, while from eight to nine is the ordinary age at which employment
in these mines commences.</p>

<p>2. That a very large proportion of the persons employed in carrying on
the work of these mines is under thirteen years of age; and a still
larger proportion between thirteen and eighteen.</p>

<p>3. That in several districts female children begin to work in these
mines at the same early ages as the males.</p>

<p>7. That the nature of the employment which is assigned to the youngest
children, generally that of "trapping," requires that they should be in
the pit as soon as the work of the day commences, and, according to the
present system, that they should not leave the pit before the work of
the day is at an end.</p>

<p>8. That although this employment scarcely deserves the name of labour,
yet, as the children engaged in it are commonly excluded from light and
are always without companions, it would, were it not for the passing and
re-passing of the coal carriages, amount to solitary confinement of the
worst order.</p>

<p>9. That in those districts in which the seams of coal are so thick that
horses go direct to the workings, or in which the side passages from the
workings to the horseways are not of any great length, the lights in the
main ways render the situation of these children comparatively less
cheerless, dull, and stupefying; but that in some districts they remain
in solitude and darkness during the whole time they are in the pit,
and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span> according to their own account, many of them never see the light
of day for weeks together during the greater part of the winter season,
excepting on those days in the week when work is not going on, and on
the Sundays.</p>

<p>10. That at different ages, from six years old and upwards, the hard
work of pushing and dragging the carriages of coal from the workings to
the main ways, or to the foot of the shaft, begins; a labour which all
classes of witnesses concur in stating requires the unremitting exertion
of all the physical power which the young workers possess.</p>

<p>11. That, in the districts in which females are taken down into the coal
mines, both sexes are employed together in precisely the same kind of
labour, and work for the same number of hours; that the girls and boys,
and the young men and young women, and even married women and women with
child, commonly work almost naked, and the men, in many mines, quite
naked; and that all classes of witnesses bear testimony to the
demoralizing influence of the employment of females underground.</p>

<p>13. That when the workpeople are in full employment, the regular hours
of work for children and young persons are rarely less than eleven; more
often they are twelve; in some districts they are thirteen; and in one
district they are generally fourteen and upwards.</p>

<p>14. That in the great majority of these mines night-work is a part of
the ordinary system of labour, more or less regularly carried on
according to the demand for coals, and one which the whole body of
evidence shows to act most injuriously both on the physical and moral
condition of the workpeople, and more especially on that of the children
and young persons.</p>


<p>15. <span class="smcap"><a name="Description_of_the_Condition_of_Manchester_by_John_Robertson_Surgeon" id="Description_of_the_Condition_of_Manchester_by_John_Robertson_Surgeon"></a>Description of the Condition of Manchester by John Robertson,
Surgeon</span> [<i>Report of Committee on Health of Towns</i>, 1840 (<i>XI</i>),
<i>pp.</i> 221-222, <i>App. II</i>], 1840.</p>

<p>Until twelve years ago there was no paving and sewering Act in any of
the townships; even in the township of Manchester, containing in the
year 1831 upwards of 142,000 inhabitants, this was the case; and the
disgraceful condition of the streets and sewers on the invasion of the
cholera you have no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span> doubt learned from Dr. Kay's able and valuable
pamphlet.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> At the present time the paving of the streets proceeds
rapidly in every direction, and great attention is given to the drains.
Upon the whole, it is gratifying to bear testimony to the zeal of the
authorities in carrying on the salutary improvements, especially when it
is known that no street can be paved and sewered without the consent of
the owners of property, unless a certain large proportion of the land on
either side is built upon. Owing to this cause several important streets
remain to this hour disgraceful nuisances.</p>

<p>Manchester has no Building Act, and hence, with the exception of certain
central streets, over which the Police Act gives the Commissioners
power, each proprietor builds as he pleases. New cottages, with or
without cellars, huddled together row behind row, may be seen springing
up in many parts, but especially in the township of Manchester, where
the land is higher in price than the land for cottage sites in other
townships is. With such proceedings as these the authorities cannot
interfere. A cottage row may be badly drained, the streets may be full
of pits, brimful of stagnant water, the receptacle of dead cats and
dogs, yet no one may find fault. The number of cellar residences, you
have probably learned from the papers published by the Manchester
Statistical Society, is very great in all quarters of the town; and even
in Hulme, a large portion of which consists of cottages recently
erected, the same practice is continued. That it is an evil must be
obvious on the slightest consideration, for how can a hole underground
of from 12 to 15 feet square admit of ventilation so as to fit it for a
human habitation?</p>

<p>We have no authorised inspector of dwellings and streets. If an epidemic
disease were to invade, as happened in 1832, the authorities would
probably order inspection, as they did on that occasion, but it would be
merely by general permission, not of right.</p>

<p>So long as this and other great manufacturing towns were multiplying and
extending their branches of manufacture and were prosperous, every fresh
addition of operatives found employment, good wages, and plenty of food;
and so long as the families of working people are well fed, it is
certain they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span> maintain their health in a surprising manner, even in
cellars and other close dwellings. Now, however, the case is different.
Food is dear, labour scarce, and wages in many branches very low;
consequently, as might be expected, disease and death are making unusual
havoc. In the years 1833, 1834, 1835, and 1836 (years of prosperity),
the number of fever cases admitted into the Manchester House of Recovery
amounted only to 1,685, or 421 per annum; while in the two pinching
years, 1838 and 1839, the number admitted was 2,414, or 1,207 per annum.
It is in such a depressed state of the manufacturing districts as at
present exists that unpaved and badly sewered streets, narrow alleys,
close, unventilated courts and cellars, exhibit their malign influence
in augmenting the sufferings which that greatest of all physical evils,
want of sufficient food, inflicts on young and old in large towns, but
especially on the young.</p>

<p>Manchester has no public park or other grounds where the population can
walk and breathe the fresh air. New streets are rapidly extending in
every direction, and so great already is the expanse of the town, that
those who live in the more populous quarters can seldom hope to see the
green face of nature.... In this respect Manchester is disgracefully
defective; more so, perhaps, than any other town in the empire. Every
advantage of this nature has been sacrificed to the getting of money in
the shape of ground-rents.</p>

<p>Progress in methods of agriculture (No. 4) and the movement towards
enclosure and consolidation (Nos. 1-3 and 5-9) are the subjects
illustrated in this section. Great advances were made in the science and
practice of farming between the end of the Commonwealth and the repeal
of the Corn Laws. But the controversial subject of enclosure overshadows
everything else. And, as is shown by the extract from Arthur Young's
account of the famous Norfolk farming, agricultural progress was closely
connected with enclosure and consolidation (No. 4). Specimens are given
of two stages of enclosure proceedings (No. 1 and No. 3), which suggest
that voluntary agreements ratified in Chancery gradually merged in
enclosure by Act, compulsory upon a dissatisfied minority. The Awards,
on which the justice or injustice of the settlement would in some degree
depend, are generally too long for quotation. But the General Act of
1801 (No. 8) was an attempt to codify the best existing practice, and
gives a general view of the practice of the best Commissioners.</p>

<p>A mass of controversial literature on both sides deals with the reasons
and effects of the enclosures. The advantages, from the point of view of
a large landowner, are set out in a text book for land stewards (No. 2).
The reverse side, as it appeared to the small holder, is given in a
petition, which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span> fruitless, against the enclosure of a
Northamptonshire village (No. 5). Arthur Young's criticism of the way in
which the process was carried out is of great importance, because he had
been the most strenuous advocate of enclosing and because he had had
unrivalled opportunities of judging the change, both as an independent
traveller and as secretary of the Board of Agriculture (No. 7). The best
printed material for an independent judgment is to be found in the
surveys made by this, a semi-official Society of Agriculture, whose
agents, with easily recognisable degrees of impartiality, describe the
objects, methods and results of the enclosing movement in different
counties. Extracts are given from their reports (No. 6), together with
the first real reform of procedure, made when the nineteenth century was
far advanced, so as to safeguard the interests of the peasantry (No. 9).</p>

<p>Forasmuch as heretofore by order and decree of this Court bearing date
the fifteenth day of September last past, made between the parties above
named, for the reasons then appearing to this Court it was then ordered
and decreed by the consent of all the said parties ... that all the
lands and grounds lying and being in the three common fields called the
Hitherfield, Midlefield and Fairfield lying at Bishop Auckland, therein
mentioned should ... be forthwith measured and divided according to the
agreements and consents of the said parties, ... and also that every of
the said parties should have his and their particular shares, parts, and
proportions therein particularly allotted and set forth in severalty
unto him and them, to be by them respectively hedged, fenced, enclosed
and enjoyed in severalty for ever thenafter for the better husbandry and
improvement thereof.... And now upon the motion of Mr. William Brabart
... alleging that since the making of the said decree several of the
parties thereunto, perceiving that some of the defendants, formerly
being the chief opposers of the said intended division, have obtained
their shares in the premisses to be in such part thereof as themselves
desired, their said parts being small and inconsiderable, they have
therefore of late descended from their shares and parts of the premisses
formerly by them desired or consented unto and do now endeavour to have
their proportionate parts to lie in other parts and places of the
premisses, to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span> great decay, hindrance, and obstruction of the said
division, notwithstanding their former consents thereunto. It was
therefore humbly prayed by the said Counsel that a Commission might be
awarded out of this Court to indifferent Commissioners ... as well for
the hearing of all the said objections ... as also to view and divide
all the said premisses and to appoint and set forth to every of the said
parties their proportionable parts therein.</p>

<p>Forasmuch as ... every owner's share hath been duly set out ... and yet

Duty and Office of a Land Steward, 3rd Ed.</i>, 1731, <i>pp.</i> 25, 26, <i>and</i>
39], 1731.</p>

<p>A Steward should not forget to make the best enquiry into the
disposition of any of the freeholders within or near any of his Lord's
manors to sell their lands, that he may use his best endeavours to
purchase them at as reasonable a price, as may be for his Lord's
advantage and convenience&mdash;especially in such manors, where improvements
are to be made by inclosing commons and common-field; which (as every
one, who is acquainted with the late improvement in agriculture, must
know) is not a little advantageous to the nation in general, as well as
highly profitable to the undertaker. If the freeholders cannot all be
persuaded to sell, yet at least an agreement for inclosing should be
pushed forward by the steward, and a scheme laid, wherein it may appear
that an exact and proportional share will be allotted to every
proprietor; persuading them first, if possible, to sign a form of
agreement, and then to choose commissioners on both sides.</p>

<p>If the Steward be a man of good sense, he will find a necessity for
making a use of it all, in rooting out superstition from amongst them,
as what is so great a hindrance to all noble im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>provements? The
substance of what is proper for the proprietors to sign before an
inclosure is to be made, may be conceived in some such form as
followeth.</p>

<p>"Whereas it is found, by long experience, that common or open fields,
wherever they are suffered or continued, are great hindrances to a
public good, and the honest improvement which every one might make of
his own, by diligence and a seasonable charge: and, whereas the common
objections hitherto raised against inclosures are founded on mistakes,
as if inclosures contributed either to hurt or ruin the poor; whilst it
is plain that (when an enclosure is once resolved on) the poor will be
employed for many years, in planting and preserving the hedges, and
afterwards will be set to work both in the tillage and pasture, wherein
they may get an honest livelihood: And whereas all or most of the
inconveniences and misfortunes which usually attend the open wastes and
common fields have been fatally experienced at&mdash;&mdash;, to the great
discouragement of industry and good husbandry in the freeholders, viz.,
that the poor take their advantage to pilfer, and steal, and trespass;
that the corn is subject to be spoiled by cattle, that stray out of the
commons and highways adjacent; that the tenants or owners, if they would
secure the fruits of their labours to themselves, are obliged either to
keep exact time in sowing and reaping or else to be subject to the
damage and inconvenience that must attend the lazy practices of those
who sow unseasonably, suffering their corn to stand to the beginning of
winter, thereby hindering the whole parish from eating the herbage of
the common field till the frosts have spoiled the most of it," etc.,
etc.</p>

<p>To conclude this article upon commons,<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> I would advise all noblemen
and gentlemen, whose tenants hold their lands by Copy of Court Roll for
three lives, not to let them renew, except they will agree to deliver up
their Copy, in order to alter the tenure by converting it to leasehold
on lives. This method will put a stop to that unreasonable custom of the
widow holding a life by her free-bench, which is a fourth life, not
covenanted for in the Copy, but only pretended to by custom; which
deprives the lord of an undoubted right of making the best, and doing
what he will with his own.</p>

<p>A Petition of Stephen Croft, the Younger, Esquire, Lord of the manor of
Stillington, in the county of York, and owner of several estates, within
the said manor and parish of Stillington, and also Improprietor of the
Great Tithes there; of the Reverend James Worsley, Clerk, Prebandary of

Stillington aforesaid, of the Reverend Lawrence Sterne, Clerk, Vicar of
the said parish,<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> and of William Stainforth, Esquire, and of several
other persons, whose names are thereunto subscribed, being also owners
of copyhold messuages, cottages, estates, and other properties, within

that, within the said manor and parish, is a common, or waste, called
Stillington Common, and also open fields and ings,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> which, in their

great advantage to the several persons interested in the said common,
fields and ings, if they were enclosed and divided into specific
allotments, and all rights of common and average thereon, or upon any
other commonable lands in the said parish, were extinguished, or if the
said common was so inclosed, and a power given to the several
proprietors and owners of estates in the said fields and ings, to flat
and inclose the same, first making satisfaction to the improprietor upon
the tithes thereof; and after the flatting and inclosing the same, all
right of common, or average, was to cease; and therefore praying, that
leave may be given to bring in a Bill for the purposes aforesaid, or any

<i>Vol. II, Letter XIV, pp.</i> 150, 156, 161], 1771.</p>

<p>As I shall presently leave Norfolk it will not be improper to give a
slight review of the husbandry which has rendered the name of this
county so famous in the farming world. Pointing out the practices which
have succeeded so nobly here, may perhaps be of some use to other
countries possessed of the same advantages, but unknowing in the art to
use them.</p>

<p>From forty to fifty years ago, all the northern and western, and a part
of the eastern tracts of the county, were sheep walks, let so low as
from 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 2<i>s.</i> an acre. Much of it was in this
condition only thirty years ago. The great improvements have been made
by means of the following circumstances.</p>

<p>First. By inclosing without the assistance of parliament.</p>

<p>Second. By a spirited use of marl and clay.</p>

<p>Third. By the introduction of an excellent course of crops.</p>

<p>Fourth. By the culture of turnips well hand-hoed.</p>

<p>Fifth. By the culture of clover and ray-grass.</p>

<p>Sixth. By landlords granting long leases.</p>

<p>Seventh. By the country being divided chiefly into large farms.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class='center'><i>The Course of Crops.</i><a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>After the best managed inclosure, and the most spirited conduct in
marling, still the whole success of the undertaking depends on this
point: No fortune will be made in Norfolk by farming, unless a judicious
course of crops be pursued. That which has been chiefly adopted by the
Norfolk farmers is,</p>

<p>
1. Turnips.<br />
2. Barley.<br />
3. Clover: or clover and ray-grass.<br />
4. Wheat.<br />

<p>If the preceding articles are properly reviewed, it will at once be
apparent that no small farmers could effect such great things as have
been done in Norfolk. Inclosing, marling, and keeping a flock of sheep
large enough for folding, belong absolutely and exclusively to great
farmers.... Nor should it be forgotten that the best husbandry in
Norfolk is that of the largest farmers.... Great farms have been the
soul of the Norfolk culture: split them into tenures of an hundred
pounds a year, you will find nothing but beggars and weeds in the whole
county.</p>

<p>A Petition of the hereunder-signed small Proprietors of Land and Persons
entitled to Rights of Common [at Raunds, Northamptonshire].</p>

<p>That the petitioners beg leave to represent to the House that, under the
pretence of improving lands in the same parish, the cottagers and other
persons entitled to right of common on the lands intended to be
enclosed, will be deprived of an inestimable privilege, which they now
enjoy, of turning a certain number of their cows, calves, and sheep, on
and over the said lands; a privilege that enables them not only to
maintain themselves and their families in the depth of winter, when they
cannot, even for their money, obtain from the occupiers of other lands
the smallest portion of milk or whey for such necessary purpose, but in
addition to this, they can now supply the grazier with young or lean
stock at a reasonable price, to fatten and bring to market at a more
moderate rate for general consumption, which they conceive to be the
most rational and effectual way of establishing public plenty and
cheapness of provision; and they further conceive, that a more ruinous
effect of this enclosure will be the almost total depopulation of their
town, now filled with bold and hardy husbandmen, from among whom, and
the inhabitants of other open parishes, the nation has hitherto derived
its greatest strength and glory, in the supply of its fleets and armies,
and driving them, from necessity and want of employ, in vast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span> crowds,
into manufacturing towns, where the very nature of their employment,
over the loom or the forge, soon may waste their strength, and
consequently debilitate their posterity, and by imperceptible degrees
obliterate that great principle of obedience to the Laws of God and
their country, which forms the character of the simple and artless
villagers, more equally distributed through the open counties, and on
which so much depends the good order and government of the state. These
are some of the injuries to themselves as individuals, and of the ill
consequences to the public, which the petitioners conceive will follow
from this, as they have already done from many enclosures, but which
they did not think they were entitled to lay before the House (the
constitutional patron and protector of the poor) until it unhappily came
to their own lot to be exposed to them through the Bill now pending.</p>

Agriculture</span>, 1798-1809.</p>

<p><i>Somersetshire</i> [<i>J. Billingsley, Somerset</i>, 1798, <i>pp.</i> 48-50 <i>and</i>
52].</p>

<p>Let us begin with taking a view of the objections which have been
started to this species of improvement, and see if we cannot prove them
to be for the most part either false or frivolous.</p>

<p>1st. Invasion of the rights and interest of the cottagers.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The foremost of these objections carries with it the appearance of a
humane attention to the comfort of the poor; but a brief investigation
will lessen its influence, if not totally refute it.</p>

<p>There are but two modes of enclosing commons. First, by unanimous
consent of the parties claiming rights, who delegate power to
commissioners, chosen by themselves, to ascertain their validity, and
divide them accordingly, under covenants and agreements properly drawn
and executed for the purpose. Or secondly, by act of parliament obtained
by the petition of a certain proportion of the commoners, both in number
and value, whereby a minority, sanctioned only by ignorance, prejudice,
or selfishness, is precluded from defeating the ends of private
advantage and public utility.</p>

<p>In point of economy, the first of these methods is most eligible, as it
saves the expense of an act of parliament, with an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span> equal security to
the proprietors. But it is seldom practised unless in commons on a small
scale, from the difficulty of procuring the consent of every individual
claimant, without which it cannot be accomplished.</p>

<p>In either of these methods, it is manifest that the right of the
cottager cannot be invaded; since with respect to legal or equitable
construction, he stands precisely on the same ground with his more
opulent neighbours; and as to his interest, I can truly declare that, in
all cases which have fallen within my observation, inclosures have
meliorated his condition, by exciting a spirit of activity and industry,
whereby habits of sloth have been by degrees overcome, and supineness
and inactivity have been exchanged for vigour and exertion.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Besides, moral effects of an injurious tendency accrue to the cottager
from a reliance on the imaginary benefits of stocking a common. The
possession of a cow or two, with a hog, and a few geese, naturally
exalts the peasant, in his own conception, above his brothers in the
same rank of society. It inspires some degree of confidence in a
property, inadequate to his support. In sauntering after his cattle, he
acquires a habit of indolence. Quarter, half, and occasionally whole
days are imperceptibly lost. Day labour becomes disgusting; the aversion
increases by indulgence; and at length the sale of a half-fed calf, or
hog, furnishes the means of adding intemperance to idleness. The sale of
the cow frequently succeeds, and its wretched and disappointed
possessor, unwilling to resume the daily and regular course of labour,
from whence he drew his former subsistence, by various modes of artifice
and imposition, exacts from the poor's rate the relief to which he is in
no degree entitled.</p>

<p><i>Lincolnshire</i> [<i>Arthur Young, Lincoln</i>, 1799, <i>pp.</i> 85-6].</p>

<p>[Evidence of Elmhurst, a Commissioner under Enclosure Act.]</p>

<p>Another observation I at the first made, and ever after put in practice,
was this, always to begin to line out and allot for the smallest
proprietors first (whether rich or poor) in every parish, so as to make
such allotment as proper and convenient for the occupation of such, or
their tenant (as that might be) to occupy; and so on, from the smallest
to the greatest: for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span> it is for the advantage of the greatest and most
opulent proprietors that a bill is presented and act passed; and at
their requests, and not the small ones; and, as the little ones would
have no weight by opposition, they must submit, was it ever so
disadvantageous to them; as it very often happens; and, therefore, there
can be no partiality in defending those who cannot help or defend
themselves; and a little man may as well have nothing allotted to him,
as to have it so far off, or so inconvenient for him, that it is not
worth his having, as it would prevent his going to his daily labour;
and, therefore, he must sell his property to his rich and opulent
adjoining neighbours; and that, in some measure, decreases population.</p>

were 46 commonable rights; the whole divided according to value; very
few little proprietors; but small occupiers suffered.</p>

heifers; or a mare and foal; or two horses; and also to cut furze.</p>

<p>Poor. They kept geese on the common, of which they are deprived. But in
fuel they are benefited; an allotment not to exceed <small> <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub></small> let, and the
rent applied in coals for all not occupying above 5<i>l.</i> a year: this is
to the advantage of those at Southborough, having enough allowed for
their consumption; at Cranworth the poor are more numerous, and the
coals of little use.</p>

<p>The commons were enclosed in 1801: all cottagers that claimed had
allotments; and one for fuel to the whole; but the cottages did not
belong to the poor; the allotments in general went to the larger
proprietors, and the poor consequently were left, in this respect,
destitute; many cows were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span> kept before, few now. All the poor very much
against the measure.</p>

<p>Poor.&mdash;An allotment of not less than 50<i>l.</i> a year, for distributing to
the poor in coals, was ordered by the act; it let for 98<i>l.</i> There were
100 commonable right houses. They used to sell a cottage of 3<i>l.</i> a
year, with a right, for 80<i>l.</i> For each, four acres were allotted: and
the cottage with this allotment would now sell for 160<i>l.</i> And what is
very remarkable, every man who proved to the Commissioners that they had
been in the habit of keeping stock on the common, was considered as
possessing a common-right and had an allotment in lieu of it. Nor was it
an unpopular measure, for there were only two men against it from the
first to the last.</p>

<p><i>Gloucestershire</i> [<i>Thomas Rudge, Gloucester</i>, 1807, <i>pp.</i> 92-93].</p>

<p>In all Acts of Inclosure, it might perhaps be proper, as it would
certainly be equitable, to relieve the pressure which weighs on small
proprietors, in a degree not proportioned to the advantages they derive
from them: for it should be remembered, that the expence of fencing a
small allotment is considerable greater than that of a larger one,
according to the quantity; that is, a square piece of land containing
ten acres will cost half as much as forty, though only of one-fourth
value. This disproportion occasions much reluctance in the class of
proprietors before-mentioned; and though it is frequently overcome by
the superior influence of the great landholders, yet the injustice of it
cannot but strike the considerate mind with conviction.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p><i>Leicestershire</i> [<i>William Pitt, Leicester</i>, 1809, <i>pp.</i> 15,16 <i>and</i>

<p>The enclosure of this vale<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> has not at all, I believe, hitherto
lessened the number of its inhabitants, as the farms are small, and few
changes of tenantry have taken place. The farmer and his family take a
hand in the business, yet few can do without a male and female servant,
and labourer, who may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span> have a family: these with the necessary
mechanics, blacksmith, wheelwright, tailor, weaver, etc., form a
considerable population in each village, I should suppose about 10 or 12
to every 100 acres.... As the tendency of the country is to pasture and
feeding, the rejected occupier and his family must emigrate into towns,
or elsewhere, for employ.</p>

<p>The management of the Duke of Rutland's property has always been
conducted in the most liberal and benevolent manner; yet I think the
enclosure of a rich district, and converting it to grass, has a natural
tendency to decrease the population of that district; less corn is
certainly now raised in Belvoir than in its open state.</p>

<p>Mr. Ainsworth complains that labourers have not in general sufficient
gardens, nor even cottages, for want of which they are driven into
towns; and that in many cases by enclosures the cottages have been
suffered to go to decay, as the land would let for as much rent without
them to the larger farmers, and by turning it to grass, fewer labourers'
cottages are wanting.</p>

<p><i>Northamptonshire</i> [<i>William Pitt, Northampton</i>, 1809, <i>p.</i> 70].</p>

<p>From the observations I have made in this county, I have no doubt but,
if the average produce of common fields be three quarters per acre, the
same land will, after a little rest as grass, and the improvements to be
effected by enclosure, produce, on an average, four quarters per acre;
and I believe that the produce of every common field may be increased in
a like proportion by enclosure and an improved cultivation.</p>

into the Propriety of Applying Wastes, etc.</i>, 1801, <i>pp.</i> 13 <i>and</i> 42],
1801.</p>

<p>Go to an alehouse kitchen of an old enclosed country, and there you will
see the origin of poverty and poor rates. For whom are they to be sober?
For whom are they to save? (Such are their questions.) For the parish?
If I am diligent, shall I have leave to build a cottage? If I am sober,
shall I have land for a cow? If I am frugal, shall I have half an acre
of potatoes? You offer no motives; you have nothing but a parish officer
and a workhouse! Bring me another pot.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span></p><hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Objection VIII. Wastes are as much property as my house.</p>

<p>Will a farmer give up his right of commonage?</p>

<p>I will not dispute their meaning<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>; but the poor look to facts, not
meanings: and the fact is, that by nineteen enclosure bills in twenty
they are injured, in some grossly injured. It may be said that
commissioners are sworn to do justice. What is that to the people who
suffer? It must be generally known that they suffer in their own
opinions, and yet enclosures go on by commissioners, who dissipate the
poor people's cows wherever they come, as well those kept legally as
those which are not. What is it to the poor man to be told that the
Houses of Parliament are extremely tender of property, while the father
of the family is forced to sell his cow and his land because the one is
not competent to the other; and being deprived of the only motive to
industry, squanders the money, contracts bad habits, enlists for a
soldier, and leaves the wife and children to the parish? If enclosures
were beneficial to the poor, rates would not rise as in other parishes
after an act to enclose. The poor in these parishes may say, and with
truth, <i>Parliament may be tender of property</i>; <i>all I know is, I had a
cow, and act of Parliament has taken it from me</i>. And thousands may make
this speech with truth.</p>


<p>8. <span class="smcap"><a name="Enclosure_Consolidating_Act" id="Enclosure_Consolidating_Act"></a>Enclosure Consolidating Act</span> [<i>Statutes, Geo. III, 109</i>],
1801.</p>

<p>An Act for consolidating in one act certain provisions usually inserted
in acts of inclosure; and for facilitating the mode of proving the
several facts usually required on the passing of such acts.</p>

<p>II. No commissioner shall be capable of being a purchaser of any part or
parts of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments within any parish in
which the lands and grounds intended to be inclosed are situate, either
in his own name, or in the name or names of any person or persons, until
five years after the date and execution of the award to be made by any
such commissioner or commissioners.</p>

<p>IV. And be it further enacted, that a true, exact, and particular
survey, admeasurement, plan, and valuation, of all the lands and grounds
to be divided, allotted, and inclosed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span> by any such act, and also of all
the messuages, cottages, orchards, gardens, homesteads, ancient inclosed
lands and grounds, within any such parish or manor, shall be made and
reduced in writing, by such commissioner or commissioners, or by such
other person or persons as he or they shall nominate and appoint, as
soon as conveniently may be, for the purposes of such act.</p>

<p>VI. And be it further enacted, that all persons, and bodies corporate or
politic, who shall have or claim any common or other right to or in any
such lands so to be inclosed, shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
such commissioner or commissioners, or one of them, at some one of such
meetings as the said commissioner or commissioners shall appoint for the
purpose (or within such further time, if any, as the said commissioner
or commissioners shall for some special reason think proper to allow for
that purpose) an account or schedule in writing, signed by them, or
their respective husbands, guardians, trustees, committees, or agents,
of such their respective rights or claims, and therein describe the
lands and grounds, and the respective messuages, lands, tenements, and
hereditaments, in respect whereof they shall respectively claim to be
entitled to any and which of such rights in and upon the same or any
part thereof, with the name or names of the person or persons then in
the actual possession thereof, and the particular computed quantities of
the same respectively, and of what nature and extent such right is, and
also in what rights, and for what estates and interests, they claim the
same respectively, distinguishing the freehold from the copyhold or
leasehold; or on non-compliance therewith, every of them making default
therein shall, as far only as respects any claim so neglected to be
delivered, be totally barred and excluded of and from all right and
title in or upon such lands so to be divided respectively, and of and
from all benefit and advantage in or to any share or allotment thereof.</p>

<p>[All objections must be delivered in writing to the commissioners before
the meeting appointed to consider objections.]</p>

<p>VII. Provided also, and be it further enacted, that nothing herein
contained shall authorise such commissioner or commissioners to hear and
determine any difference or dispute which may arise, touching the right
or title to any lands,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span> tenements, or hereditaments, but such
commissioner or commissioners shall assign and set out the several
allotments directed to be made unto the person or persons, who, at the
time of the division and inclosure, shall have the actual seisin or
possession of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments, in lieu or in
right whereof such allotment shall be respectively made.</p>

<p>[VIII. Commissioners, before making any allotments, to appoint public
carriage roads, and prepare a map thereof to be deposited with their
clerk, and give notice thereof, and appoint a meeting, at which, if any
person shall object, the commissioners, with a justice of the division,
shall determine the matter.]</p>

<p>XII. And be it further enacted, that such commissioner or commissioners
in making the several allotments directed by any such act, shall have
due regard as well to the situation of the respective houses or
homesteads of the proprietors, as to the quantity and quality of the
lands and grounds to be allotted to them respectively, so far as may be
consistent with the general convenience of the said proprietors; and
that such commissioner or commissioners in making the said allotments
shall have particular regard to the convenience of the owners or
proprietors of the smallest estates in the lands and grounds directed to
be allotted and exchanged.</p>

<p>XIV. And be it further enacted, that the several shares of and in any
lands or grounds shall, when so allotted, be and be taken to be in full
bar of and satisfaction and compensation for their several and
respective lands, grounds, rights of common, and all other rights; and
that from and immediately after the making the said division and
allotments, and the execution of the award, all rights whatsoever, by
such act intended to be extinguished, belonging to or claimed by any
person or persons whomsoever, bodies politic or corporate, in, over, or
upon such lands or grounds, shall cease, determine, and be for ever
extinguished.</p>

<p>[XXIV and XXIX. If allotments are not enclosed and fenced within an
appointed time the commissioners may have the work done and charge the
expense to the proprietor or let the allotment and apply the rents till
the expenses are paid. If it has been provided by an act that the
expenses of obtaining and executing it are to be shared among the
proprietors of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span> allotments the commissioners may levy them by distress
and sale of the goods of those who fail to pay at the appointed times.]</p>

<p>XXXII. And be it further enacted, that in case it shall be provided by
any such act, that the expenses attending the same shall be paid by sale
of any part of the land so to be inclosed, the said commissioner or
commissioners shall mark and set out such part or parts of the said
waste or commonable lands, as in his or their opinion will by sale
thereof raise a sum of money sufficient to pay and discharge all such
charges and expenses as may by any such act be directed to be paid and
discharged out of the same; and the said commissioner or commissioners
shall sell such part or parts of the said lands to any person or persons
for the best price or prices that can be gotten for the same.</p>

<p>XXXV. And be it further enacted, that as soon as conveniently may be
after the division and allotment of the said lands and grounds shall be
finished, pursuant to the purport and directions of this or any such
act, the said commissioner or commissioners shall form and draw up, or
cause to be formed and drawn up, an award in writing, which shall
express the quantity of acres, roods, and perches, in statute measure,
contained in the said lands and grounds, and the quantity of each and
every part and parcel thereof which shall be so allotted, assigned, or
exchanged, and the situations and descriptions of the same respectively,
and shall also contain a description of the roads, ways, footpaths,
watercourses, watering places, quarries, bridges, fences, and land
marks, set out and appointed by the said commissioner or commissioners
respectively as aforesaid, and all such other rules, orders, agreements,
regulations, directions, and determinations, as the said commissioner or
commissioners shall think necessary, proper, or beneficial to the
parties; which said award shall be fairly ingrossed or written on
parchment, and shall be read and executed by the commissioner or
commissioners, in the presence of the proprietors who may attend at a
special general meeting called for that purpose, of which ten days'
notice at least shall be given in some paper to be named in such act and
circulating in the county, which execution of such award shall be
proclaimed the next Sunday in the church of the parish in which such
lands shall be, from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span> time of which proclamation only, and not
before, such award shall be considered as complete.</p>

<p>XL. And be it further enacted and declared that nothing in such act
contained shall lessen, prejudice, or defeat the right, title, or
interest of any lord or lady of any manor or lordship, or reputed manor
or lordship, within the jurisdiction or limits whereof the lands and
grounds thereby directed to be divided and allotted are situate, lying,
and being of, in, or to the seigniories, rights, and royalties incident
or belonging to such manor or lordship, or reputed manor or lordship, or
to the lord or lady thereof, or to any person or persons claiming under
him or her, but the same (other than and except the interest and other
property as is or are meant or intended to be barred by such act) shall
remain, in as full, ample, and beneficial manner, to all intents and
purposes, as he or she might or ought to have held or enjoyed such
rights before the passing of such act, or in case the same had never
been made.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century was nearly a blank period in the history of
direct regulation of industrial conditions by the State. There was no
systematic intervention on the scale of Tudor or Victorian times; and
political opinion hardened against the principle and destroyed the
machinery which had been inherited from the sixteenth century. Such
machinery, for the regulation of wages, was still occasionally used in
the early part of the eighteenth century, as is shown by occasional
examples of wages assessments at Quarter Sessions (No. 2). Acts were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
passed for individual trades forbidding the practice of paying wages in
truck (No. 1). Local pressure even obtained a special Act providing for
the regulation of London silk-weavers' wages (No. 3, No. 4). This
Spitalfields Act was used as a precedent for the proposals to extend the
policy of regulation, which began to fill the Journals of the House of
Commons during the period when the new machinery and methods and the
French wars dislocated employment and wages. Examples are given of
petitions asking that wages should be regulated and that the limitation
of apprentices should be enforced under the statute 5 Elizabeth c. 4, to
which attention had been called (Nos. 10, 11, 12 and 14). Independent
attempts were made to set up a minimum wage, directly and through
wages-boards (Nos. 5, 6 and 19). All these applications ended in
complete failure. Parliament provided a system of arbitration for the
cotton industry (Nos. 7 and 8), but repealed both the wages and
apprenticeship clauses of the Elizabethan Act. Contemporary opinion in
Parliament relied on the working of free bargaining and economic forces
(Debates on Whitbread's Bill and on Apprenticeship, Nos. 6 and 13).</p>

<p>The history of Factory legislation (Nos. 9, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22)
shows how the policy of non-interference was abandoned in another field.
The employment of children in the new factories was one result of the
eighteenth century system of Poor relief. It produced horrors which the
first Factory Act was designed to remedy (No. 9). But the use of
steam-power and the growth of big industrial districts led to the
wholesale employment of children not under the Poor Law. Public opinion
was at last aroused by the campaigns of Oastler and others, who pointed
to the contrast between the Anti-Slavery agitation and the conditions of
the English mills (No. 17). The successive Acts of 1819, 1833, 1842 and
1844 (Nos. 16, 18, 20, 22) show how legislators were forced to extend
the principle of regulation from children to young persons and women,
and from cotton mills to other textile factories and to mines. In the
debate on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span> Act of 1844 the respective points of view of the Tory
philanthropist, the political economist, and the manufacturer, were
dramatically contrasted (No. 21). The last extract is from one of a
series of reports on the condition of great industrial towns (No. 23),
by which Chadwick, a disciple of Bentham and a champion of the new
Poor-law, forced Parliament to interfere in the economic control of town
life.</p>

1773.</p>

<p>An Act to impower the magistrates therein mentioned to settle and
regulate the wages of persons employed in the Silk Manufacture within
their respective jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Whereas it would be for the benefit of persons employed in the Silk
Manufacture, if the magistrates were impowered to settle, between the
master weavers and their journeymen, the price of labour in the several
branches of the said manufacture; be it therefore enacted by the King's
most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords
spiritual and temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament,
assembled and by the authority of the same, that from and after the
first day of July, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-three, the
wages and prices for work of the journeymen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span> weavers within the city of
London shall be settled, regulated, and declared, by the Lord Mayor,
Recorder and Aldermen, of the said city; and in all places in the county
of Middlesex, by the Justices of the Peace for the said county; and in
all places within the city and liberty of Westminster, at the General
Quarter Sessions of the peace holden in and for the said city and
liberty; and in all places within the liberty of the Tower of London, at
the General Quarter Sessions of the Peace holden in and for the said
liberty, at their General Quarter Sessions of the Peace respectively;
and the Lord Mayor, Recorder and Aldermen of the city of London, and the
said Justices of the Peace, are hereby respectively authorised and
impowered, from time to time, upon application being made to them for
that purpose, to settle, regulate, order, and declare the wages and
prices of work of the journeymen weavers working within their respective
jurisdictions as aforesaid; and shall and may, within the space of
fourteen days next after the making every such order, cause the same to
be printed and published, at the reasonable expense of the person or
persons applying for the same, three times, in any two daily newspapers
published in London or Westminster; which publication shall be deemed
and allowed to be sufficient notice and publication thereof; and from
and after publication thereof, all weavers, and their journeymen, are
hereby strictly required to observe the same.</p>

<p>And be it further enacted, that if after the said first day of July, one
thousand seven hundred and seventy-three, any master weaver, within
either of the aforesaid districts, shall give more or less wages, or pay
larger or less prices, to any of the journeymen weavers aforesaid, for
their work, than shall be settled or allowed as aforesaid, and shall be
convicted of the said offences before any two of His Majesty's Justices
of the Peace, within either of the districts or jurisdictions aforesaid
where the said offence shall be committed, on the oath or oaths of one
or more credible witness or witnesses, he shall forfeit the sum of fifty
pounds; to be levied by distress and sale of the offender's goods; and
the said penalty, when recovered, shall be paid into the hands of the
Master of the Weavers' Company, first deducting the expense of such
prosecution, to be distributed by him, in conjunction with the Wardens
of the said company, to any distressed journeymen weavers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span> or their
families, who shall have been last employed in either of the aforesaid
jurisdictions, at their discretion.</p>

<p>And be it further enacted, that if any journeyman weaver or weavers
within the districts aforesaid, shall ask, receive, or take more or less
wages, or larger or less prices for their work than shall be settled by
the respective quarter-sessions, as aforesaid; or shall enter into any
combination to raise the wages or prices of the said work, or for this
purpose shall decoy, solicit, or intimidate, any journeyman or
journeymen weavers within the districts aforesaid, so that he or they
quit their masters, for whom they shall then be employed; or shall
assemble themselves in any numbers exceeding the number of ten, in order
to frame or deliver petitions or other representations, touching their
wages or prices of work, except to the said Justices of the Peace, or to
the Lord Mayor, Recorder, and Aldermen of the city of London, at their
respective Quarter Sessions, and shall be convicted of any of the said
offences, on the oath or oaths of one or more credible witness or
witnesses, before any two or more of His Majesty's Justices of the
Peace, within either of the districts or jurisdictions aforesaid where
the offence shall be committed, [he or they] shall forfeit a sum not
exceeding forty shillings: And if the said forfeiture be not immediately
paid, it shall and may be lawful for the said Justices to commit the
said offender to the House of Correction, to hard labour, for any time
not exceeding three months; the said forfeiture, when recovered, to be
applied in the same manner as the forfeiture of fifty pounds
afore-mentioned.</p>

<p>And be it further enacted, that it shall and may be lawful for any two
Justices of the Peace, within the limits and jurisdictions aforesaid, on
information upon oath made before them by any person or persons
whatsoever, that there is reason to suspect that any master or
journeyman weaver, within the districts or jurisdictions aforesaid, hath
been guilty of any of the offences aforesaid, at request of such
informant, to issue their summons, in writing, signed by any such two
Justices, requiring any clerk, foreman, apprentice, servant, or other
person or persons employed or retained by such person so suspected to
have offended, or any other person or persons whatsoever, whose
attendance shall appear necessary for the purpose of giving evidence in
the premises, to attend and testify concerning the premises: And if any
person so summoned shall not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span> attend, and proof shall be made of the
service of such summons either personally or by leaving the same at the
last or usual place of abode of such person, it shall be lawful for such
two Justices, or any other two Justices of the Peace acting for such
county or place, and they are hereby required (unless a reasonable
excuse be made for such non-attendance to the satisfaction of such
justices) to issue their warrant, under their hands and seals, for the
apprehending and bringing him or her before them, or some other two or
more Justices of the Peace acting for such county or place, to be
examined touching the premises; and if any such person so attending or
being brought before such Justices, shall refuse to be examined or give
their testimony touching the premises, such person shall by the said
justices be committed to the House of Correction for one month, there to
remain, unless he or she shall sooner submit to be examined and give
testimony as the law requires.</p>

<p>And be it further enacted, that if any master weaver residing within the
limits aforesaid, shall, directly or indirectly, in any manner
whatsoever, retain or employ any journeyman weaver out of or beyond the
limits aforesaid, with intent or design to elude or evade this act, or
shall give, allow, or pay, or cause to be given, allowed, or paid, to
such journeyman, any more or less wages than shall be settled, as
aforesaid, every such person shall, for every such offence, forfeit
fifty pounds; to be sued for by action of debt, in any of His Majesty's
Courts of Record at Westminster, wherein no essoin, protection, or wager
of law, or more than one imparlance, shall be allowed, and wherein the
ordinary costs of the suit shall be paid; one moiety of which said
forfeiture, when recovered, shall belong and be paid to His Majesty and
His successors, and the other moiety to the person who shall sue for the
same.</p>

<p>Provided always, and be it further enacted, that nothing in this act
contained shall extend, or be construed to extend, to fix, control, or
regulate, the wages or allowances to be paid to servants in the said
business of a weaver, <i>bona fide</i> retained and employed as foreman.</p>

<p>And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and
after the passing of this act, no person or persons, being silk weavers,
residing within the districts aforesaid, shall have in his or their
service at any one time more than two apprentices, upon pain of
forfeiting for every offence the sum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span> of twenty pounds; to be levied by
distress and sale of the offender's goods and chattels, upon conviction,
on the oath or oaths of one or more credible witness or witnesses,
before two Justices of the Peace within either of the jurisdictions
aforesaid where the said offence shall be committed, and the said
penalty, when recovered, shall be paid into the hands of the Master of
the Weavers' Company, to be applied by him, as aforesaid, and the said
Justices are hereby authorised and required to discharge every such
apprentice or apprentices exceeding the number of two.</p>

[<i>Public Record Office</i>, <i>H.O.</i> 86, 26], 1773.</p>

<p>Sir John Fielding presents his respects to the Earl of Suffolk and
acquaints him that he had the pleasure yesterday of assisting at the
general Quarter Sessions for the county of Middlesex to carry into
execution the late Act of Parliament for the regulating of the wages of
journeymen weavers in Spitalfields, etc., and the wages were then
settled by a numerous and unanimous bench to the entire satisfaction of
those masters and journeymen weavers who appeared there in behalf of
their respective bodies, and I sincerely hope that this step will prove
a radical cure for all tumultuous assemblies from that quarter so
disrespectful to the King and so disagreeable to Government, as it will
amply reward your Lordship's judicious attention to a matter so
conducive to peace and good order, for by this statute your Lordship has
conveyed contentment to the minds of thousands of his Majesty's
subjects. The Act for the appointment of clergymen with proper salaries
agreeable to my proposals was also carried into execution to attend the
gaols, and this preventive step will, I am persuaded, be attended with
very salutary effects; and as the important business of the sessions is
over, I hope your Lordship will take the advantage of my Lord North's
leisure to settle the affair regarding my general prevention plan which
now lies before him for his Majesty's approbation.</p>

<p>
I am, with unfeigned truth, my Lord,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Your Lordship's respectful and the public's faithful Servant.</span><br />

<p>At a numerous meeting of the day labourers of the little parishes of
Heacham, Snettisham, and Sedgford, this day, 5th November, in the parish
church of Heacham, in the county of Norfolk, in order to take into
consideration the best and most peaceable mode of obtaining a redress of
all the severe and peculiar hardships under which they have for many
years so patiently suffered, the following resolutions were unanimously
agreed to:&mdash;1st, That <i>the labourer is worthy of his hire</i>, and that the
mode of lessening his distresses, as hath been lately the fashion, by
selling him flour under the market price, and thereby rendering him an
object of a parish rate, is not only an indecent insult on his lowly and
humble situation (in itself sufficiently mortifying from his degrading
dependence on the caprice of his employer) but a fallacious mode of
relief, and every way inadequate to a radical redress of the manifold
distresses of his calamitous state. 2nd, That the price of labour
should, at all times, be proportioned to the price of wheat, which
should invariably be regulated by the average price of that necessary
article of life; and that the price of labour, as specified in the
annexed plan, is not only well calculated to make the labourer happy
without being injurious to the farmer, but it appears to us the only
rational means of securing the permanent happiness of this valuable and
useful class of men, and, if adopted in its full extent, will have an
immediate and powerful effect in reducing, if it does not entirely
annihilate, that disgraceful and enormous tax on the public&mdash;the Poor
Rate.</p>

<p>3rd. That a petition to parliament to regulate the price of labour,
conformable to the above plan, be immediately adopted; and that the day
labourers throughout the county be invited to associate and co-operate
in this necessary application to parliament, as a peaceable, legal, and
probable mode of obtaining relief; and, in doing this, no time should be
lost, as the petition must be presented before the 29th January, 1796.</p>

<p>4th. That one shilling shall be paid into the hands of the treasurer by
every labourer, in order to defray the expenses of advertising,
attending on meetings, and paying counsel to support their petition in
parliament.</p>

<p>5th. That as soon as the sense of the day labourers of this county, or a
majority of them, shall be made known to the clerk of the meeting, a
general meeting shall be appointed, in some central town, in order to
agree upon the best and easiest mode of getting the petition signed:
when it will be requested that one labourer, properly instructed, may be
deputed to represent two or three contiguous parishes, and to attend the
above intended meeting with a list of all the labourers in the parishes
he shall represent, and pay their respective subscriptions; and that the
labourer, so deputed, shall be allowed two shillings and sixpence a day
for his time, and two shillings and sixpence a day for his expenses.</p>

<p>6th. That Adam Moore, clerk of the meeting, be directed to have the
above resolutions, with the names of the farmers and labourers who have
subscribed to and approved them, advertised in one Norwich and one
London paper; when it is hoped that the above plan of a petition to
parliament will not only be approved and immediately adopted by the day
labourer of this county, but by the labourers of every county in the
kingdom.</p>

<p>7th. That all letters, <i>post paid</i>, addressed to Adam Moore, labourer,
at Heacham, near Lynn, Norfolk, will be duly noticed.</p>

History, Vol. XXXIII, cols. 700-15</i>], 1795-6.</p>

<p><i>Debate in the Commons on Mr. Whitbread's Bill to regulate the wages of
Labourers in Husbandry. December 9.</i> Mr. Whitbread presented to the
House a bill "to explain and amend so much of the act of the 5th of
Elizabeth, intituled: 'An act containing divers orders for artificers,
labourers, servants of husbandry and apprentices,'" as empowers justices
of the peace, at, or within six weeks after, every general quarter
sessions held at Easter, to regulate the wages of labourers in
husbandry. The bill was read a first time. On the motion for the second
reading, Mr. Whitbread said, that he had brought forward this bill under
the idea that it was possible, by adopting its regulations, to give
great relief to a very numerous and useful class of the community. The
act of Elizabeth empowered justices of the peace to fix the maximum of
labour. This bill went only to empower them to fix the minimum. However
the House might decide with respect to his bill, he trusted at least
that the act of Elizabeth would be repealed.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Fox</i> said, that the bill was undoubtedly a bill of great delicacy
and importance, and with respect to which, he admitted that, to a
considerable extent, there might exist a rational difference of opinion.
The act of Elizabeth, as his hon. friend had truly stated, empowered the
justices to fix the highest price of labour, but it gave them no power
to fix the lowest. It secured the master from a risk that could but
seldom occur, of being charged exorbitantly for the quantity of service;
but it did not authorise the magistrate to protect the poor from the
injustice of a griping and avaricious employer, who might be disposed to
take advantage of their necessities, and undervalue the rate of their
service. If the price of labour was adequate to the support of the poor
at ordinary times, though not equal to the accidental high price of
provisions at the present moment, it might be contended that there was
less necessity for any new legislative regulation. But, taking the
average price of labour for some years past, including that period
during which the scarcity had operated, no man could deny that the price
of labour was greatly disproportionate to the rate of provisions. That
the general price of labour should be adequate to the support of the
general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span> mass of the community was indisputably a right principle. They
all knew that a very extensive tax was exacted from the country, under
the denomination of poor-rates, and that such a tax must be continued.
It was understood that to this fund none could apply, but those few to
whom, from particular circumstances, their labour might not be
sufficiently productive to secure an adequate support. But he feared
that the reverse was the case; that the exception was with respect to
the few who derived sufficient means of subsistence from their labour,
and that the great mass of the labouring part of the community were
under the necessity of applying to this fund for relief. If the House,
as was proposed, were to form an association, in order to pledge
themselves to use only a particular sort of bread, with a view to
diminish the pressure of the scarcity, ought they not at the same time
to form an association in order to raise the price of labour to a rate
proportionate to the price of articles of subsistence? With this view,
he called upon the House to consider the principle of the bill, and its
provisions. He would call upon them also to attend to the subject, in a
constitutional view, though he could not hope, from the complexion of
recent transactions, that this was a view of the subject which would
have great weight. It was not fitting in a free country that the great
body of the people should depend upon the charity of the rich. In the
election of members of Parliament, all those were strictly excluded from
exercising any franchise, with a very few exceptions, who had at any
time received relief from the parish. Was it becoming in a country like
this, that the general mass of the labouring part of the community,
excepting those who derived relief from the bounty and generosity of
individuals, should be excluded from the exercise of their most
important privilege as freemen! He admitted many of the rich to be
humane and charitable; but he could not allow that those who were the
most useful and industrious members of society should depend upon a fund
so precarious and degrading, as the occasional supplies derived from
their bounty. If the price of provisions had for two years been such as
to put every poor man under the necessity of applying for the aid of
parochial charity, and if that circumstance constituted a positive
disqualification with respect to the exercise of a constitutional right,
what, he asked, was the state of a country which first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span> compelled every
poor man to dependence, and then reduced him to servitude? If they were
to go into associations, pledging themselves to use a particular sort of
bread, with a view to alleviate the scarcity, it was surely of more
importance that they should associate in order to redress the more
material grievance, and strike at the fundamental source of the evil.
With this view he should be glad to see an association in order to put
the price of labour upon a footing adequate to the rate of provisions.
If the regulations of the present bill should not be adopted, he should
be happy that any other legislative enactments should be brought forward
in order to afford relief and protection to the poor.</p>

<p>The bill was ordered to be read a second time on the 3rd of February,
and to be printed.</p>

<p><i>February 12th, 1796.</i> The order of the day being read for the second
reading of the bill,</p>

<p><i>Mr. Whitbread</i> said, that ample time had been given for members to
consider maturely its object and regulations, and to collect from their
constituents such information as they might require. For his own part,
every inquiry he had instigated, convinced him of the necessity of
remedying the grievances of the industrious poor by some legislative
provisions. Whether those which he had suggested were the most proper to
be adopted, was a question for the decision of the House? Having
bestowed considerable pains in drawing up the bill, he might have left
it for their consideration upon its merits alone, did not the novelty of
the measure demand a few words in explanation. He felt as much as any
man how greatly it was to be desired that there should be no legislative
interference in matters of this nature, and that the price of labour,
like every other commodity, should be left to find its own level. From
reasonings upon the subject, the result was, that it always would find
its level. But the deductions of reason were confuted by experience; for
he appealed to the sense of the House, whether the situation of the
labouring poor in this country was such as any feeling or liberal mind
would wish? He did not mean that the wages of the labourer were
inadequate for his subsistence and comfort in times of temporary
scarcity, and unusual hardship; but even at the period preceding such
distress, the evil had prevailed. In most parts of the country, the
labourer had long been struggling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span> with increasing misery, till the
pressure had become almost too grievous to be endured, while the
patience of the sufferers under their accumulated distresses had been
conspicuous and exemplary. And did not such distress, supported with so
much fortitude, merit relief from the legislature? Were it necessary to
refer to any authority, he would quote the writings of Dr. Price, in
which he showed that in the course of two centuries, the price of labour
had not increased more than three or at most fourfold; whereas the price
of meat had increased in the proportion of six or seven; and that of
clothing, no less than fourteen or fifteen-fold in the same period. The
poor-rates, too, had increased since the beginning of the century from
&pound;600,000, at which they were then estimated, to upwards of three
millions. Nor was this prodigious increase in the poor rates to be
ascribed to the advance of population; for it was doubtful whether any
such increase had taken place. At the present period the contrary seemed
to be the case. By the pressure of the times, marriage was discouraged;
and among the laborious classes of the community, the birth of a child,
instead of being hailed as a blessing, was considered as a curse. For
this serious evil a remedy was required, and to this the bill was
directed. It was his wish to rescue the labouring poor from a state of
slavish dependence; to enable the husbandman, who dedicated his days to
incessant toil, to feed, to clothe, and to lodge his family with some
degree of comfort; to exempt the youth of the country from the necessity
of entering the army or the navy, and from flocking to great towns for
subsistence; and to put it in the power of him who ploughed and sowed
and threshed the corn, to taste of the fruits of his industry, by giving
him a right to a part of the produce of his labour. Such were the
grounds upon which the bill in question was built. To those who dreaded
everything that wore the aspect of innovation, and reprobated every
measure that was new, he would say that here there was no departure from
established precedents, no introduction of unknown principles. The
statute of the 5th of Elizabeth was enacted expressly for the purpose of
regulating the price of labour. This statute was acted upon for forty
years, when it was afterwards amended by a subsequent one in the reign
of James the 1st, bearing a similar title. He would not be understood as
commending the principle of these statutes: on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span> the contrary, he was of
opinion that they operated as a clog to industry, by permitting justices
to fix the maximum of labour. But so late as the 8th of his majesty,
justices were empowered to regulate the wages of tailors, and even now
the lord mayor and council of London control those of the silk weavers.
To those who were afraid of entrusting justices with power, he should
only say, that he left the power where he found it. At present they were
possessed of the power to oppress the labourer; and this bill only
invested them with the additional power to redress his grievances. By
fixing the minimum of the wages of labour, a comfortable subsistence was
secured to industry, and at the same time greater exertions were
prompted by the hope of greater reward. To some, perhaps, the time of
bringing this subject forward might appear exceptional. There were those
who would say, if the labourers were not distressed, why agitate a
question for which no necessity calls, and awaken desires which are not
felt? Others would maintain, that it was unseasonable to direct the
public attention to such a subject, while the pressure of distress might
excite discontents, or raise improper expectations. To these he could
only answer, that he was not one who could see wise and salutary
measures sacrificed to the pretended inconvenience of the times; and
that he was of opinion that what was proper to be done could scarcely be
done out of season. He then moved, "that the bill be now read a second
time."</p>

<p><i>Mr. Pitt</i> said, that in the interval which had taken place since the
first reading of the bill, he had paid considerable attention to the
subject, and endeavoured to collect information from the best sources to
which he had access. The evil was certainly of such a nature as to
render it of importance to find out a proper remedy, but the nature of
the remedy involved discussions of such a delicate and intricate nature,
that none should be adopted without being maturely weighed. The present
situation of the labouring poor in this country was certainly not such
as could be wished, upon any principle, either of humanity, or policy.
That class had of late been exposed to hardships which they all
concurred in lamenting, and were equally actuated by a desire to remove.
He would not argue how far the comparison of the state of the labourer,
relieved as it had been by a display of beneficence never surpassed at
any period, with the state of this class of the com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>munity in former
times, was just, though he was convinced that the representations were
exaggerated. At any rate, the comparisons were not accurate, because
they did not embrace a comprehensive view of the relative situations. He
gave the hon. gentleman ample credit for his good intentions in bringing
the present bill into parliament, though he was afraid that its
provisions were such as it would be impolitic, upon the whole, to adopt;
and such as, if adopted, would be found to be inadequate to the purposes
proposed. The authority of Dr. Price had been adduced to show the great
advance that had taken place on every article of subsistence, compared
with the slow increase of the wages of labour. But the statement of Dr.
Price was erroneous, as he compared the earnings of the labourer at the
period when the comparison is instituted, with the price of provisions,
and the earnings of the labourer at the present day, with the price of
the same articles, without adverting to the change of circumstances, and
to the difference of provisions. Corn, which was then almost the only
food of the labourer, was now supplied by cheaper substitutions, and it
was unfair to conclude that the wages of labour were so far from keeping
pace with the price of provisions, because they could no longer purchase
the same quantity of an article for which the labourer had no longer the
same demand. The simple question now to be considered was, whether the
remedy for the evil, which was admitted to a certain extent to exist,
was to be obtained by giving to the justices the power to regulate the
price of labour, and by endeavouring to establish by authority, what
would be much better accomplished by the unassisted operation of
principles? It was unnecessary to argue the general expediency of any
legislative interference, as the principles had been perfectly
recognised by the hon. gentleman himself. The most celebrated writers
upon political economy, and the experience of those states where arts
had flourished the most, bore ample testimony of their truth. They had
only to enquire, therefore, whether the present case was strong enough
for the exception, and whether the means proposed were suited to the
object intended? The hon. gentleman imagined that he had on his side of
the question the support of experience in this country, and appealed to
certain laws upon the statute-book, in confirmation of his proposition.
He did not find himself called upon to defend the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span> principle of these
statutes, but they were certainly introduced for purposes widely
different from the object of the present bill. They were enacted to
guard the industry of the country from being checked by a general
combination among labourers; and the bill now under consideration was
introduced solely for the purpose of remedying the inconveniences which
labourers sustain from the disproportion existing between the price of
labour and the price of living. He had the satisfaction to hear the hon.
gentleman acknowledge, that if the price of labour could be made to find
its own level, it would be much more desirable than to assess it by
arbitrary statute, which in the execution was liable to abuse on the one
hand, and inefficacy on the other. If the remedy succeeded according to
the most sanguine expectations, it only established what would have been
better effected by principle; and if it failed, on the one hand it might
produce the severest oppression, and on the other hand encourage the
most profligate idleness and extravagance. Was it not better for the
House, then, to consider the operation of general principles, and rely
upon the effects of their unconfined exercise? Was it not wiser to
reflect what remedy might be adopted, at once more general in its
principles, and more comprehensive in its object, less exceptional in
its example, and less dangerous in its application? They should look to
the instances where interference had shackled industry, and where the
best intentions have often produced the most pernicious effects. It was
indeed the most absurd bigotry, in asserting the general principle, to
exclude the exception; but trade, industry and barter would always find
their own level, and be impeded by regulations which violated their
natural operation, and deranged their proper effect. This being granted,
he appealed to the judgment of the House, whether it was better to refer
the matter entirely to the discretion of a magistrate, or to endeavour
to find out the causes of the evil, and by removing the causes, to apply
a remedy more justifiable in its principle, more easy in the execution,
more effectual in its operations, in fine, more consonant to every sound
and rational policy. The evil, in his opinion, originated in a great
measure in the abuses which had crept into the poor-laws of this
country, and the complicated mode of executing them. The poor-laws of
this country, however wise in their original institution, had
contributed to fetter the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span> circulation of labour, and to substitute a
system of abuses, in room of the evils which they humanely meant to
redress, and by engrafting upon a defective plan defective remedies
produced nothing but confusion and disorder. The laws of settlements
prevented the workman from going to that market where he could dispose
of his industry to the greatest advantage, and the capitalist from
employing the person who was qualified to procure him the best returns
for his advances. These laws had at once increased the burthens of the
poor, and taken from the collective resources of the state to supply
wants which their operation had occasioned, and to alleviate a poverty
which they tended to perpetuate. Such were the institutions which
misguided benevolence had introduced, and, with such warnings to deter,
it would be wise to distrust a similar mode of conduct, and to endeavour
to discover remedies of a different nature. The country had not yet
experienced the full benefit of the laws that had already been passed to
correct the errors which he had explained. From the attention he had
bestowed upon the subject, and from the enquiries he had been able to
make of others, he was disposed to think we had not yet gone far enough,
and to entertain an opinion that many advantages might be derived, and
much of the evil now complained of removed, by an extension of those
reformations in the poor-laws which had been begun. The encouragement of
friendly societies would contribute to alleviate that immense charge
with which the public was loaded in the support of the poor, and provide
by savings of industry for the comfort of distress. Now the parish
officer could not remove the workman, merely because he apprehended he
might be burthensome, but it was necessary that he should be actually
chargeable. But from the pressure of a temporary distress might the
industrious mechanic be transported from the place where his exertions
could be useful to himself and his family, to a quarter where he would
become a burthen without the capacity of even being able to provide for
himself. To remedy such a great striking grievance, the laws of
settlement ought to undergo a radical amendment. He conceived, that to
promote the free circulation of labour, to remove the obstacles by which
industry is prohibited from availing itself of its resources, would go
far to remedy the evils, and diminish the necessity of applying for
relief to the poor-rates. In the course of a few years, this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span> freedom
from the vexatious restraint which the laws imposed would supersede the
object of their institutions. The advantages would be widely diffused,
the wealth of the nation would be increased, the poor man rendered not
only more comfortable, but more virtuous, and the weight of poor-rates,
with which the landed interest is loaded, greatly diminished. He should
wish, therefore, that an opportunity were given of restoring the
original purity of the poor laws, and of removing those corruptions by
which they had been obscured. He was convinced, that the evils which
they had occasioned did not arise out of their original constitution,
but coincided with the opinion of Blackstone, that, in proportion as the
wise regulations that were established in the long and glorious reign of
Queen Elizabeth, have been superseded by subsequent enactments, the
utility of the institution has been impaired, and the benevolence of the
plan rendered fruitless. While he thus had expressed those sentiments
which the discussion naturally prompted, it might not, perhaps, be
improper, on such an occasion, to lay before the House the ideas
floating in his mind, though not digested with sufficient accuracy, nor
arranged with a proper degree of clearness. Neither what the hon.
gentleman proposed, nor what he himself had suggested, were remedies
adequate to the evil it was intended to remove. Supposing, however, the
two modes of remedying the evil were on a par in effect, the preference
in principle was clearly due to that which was least arbitrary in its
nature; but it was not difficult to perceive that the remedy proposed by
the hon. gentleman would either be completely ineffectual, or such as
far to over-reach its mark. As there was a difference in the numbers
which compose the families of the labouring poor, it must necessarily
require less to support a small family. Now by the regulations proposed,
either the man with a small family would have too much wages, or the man
with a large family, who had done most service to his country, would
have too little. So that were the minimum fixed upon the standard of a
large family, it might operate as encouragement to idleness on one part
of the community; and if it were fixed on the standard of a small
family, those would not enjoy the benefit of it for whose relief it was
intended. What measure then could be found to supply the defect? Let us,
said he, make relief in cases where there are a number of children, a
matter of right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span> and an honour, instead of a ground for opprobrium and
contempt. This will make a large family a blessing, and not a curse; and
this will draw a proper line of distinction between those who are able
to provide for themselves by their labour, and those who, after having
enriched their country with a number of children, have a claim upon its
assistance for their support. All this, however, he would confess, was
not enough, if they did not engraft upon it resolutions to discourage
relief where it was not wanted. If such means could be practised as that
of supplying the necessities of those who required assistance by giving
it in labour or affording employment, which is the principle of the act
of Elizabeth, the most important advantages would be gained. They would
thus benefit those to whom they afforded relief, not only by the
assistance bestowed, but by giving habits of industry and frugality,
and, in furnishing a temporary bounty, enable them to make permanent
provision for themselves. By giving effect to the operation of friendly
societies, individuals would be rescued from becoming a burthen upon the
public, and, if necessary, be enabled to subsist upon a fund which their
own industry contributed to raise. These great points of granting relief
according to the number of children, preventing removals at the caprice
of the parish officer, and making them subscribe to friendly societies,
would tend, in a very great degree, to remove every complaint to which
the present partial remedy could be applied. Experience had already
shown how much could be done by the industry of children and the
advantages of early employing them in such branches of manufacture as
they are capable to execute. The extension of schools of industry was
also an object of material importance. If any one would take the trouble
to compute the amount of all the earnings of the children who are
already educated in this manner, he would be surprised, when he came to
consider the weight which their support by their own labours took off
the country, and the addition which, by the fruits of their toil, and
the habits to which they were formed, was made to its internal opulence.
The suggestion of these schools was originally drawn from Lord Hale and
Mr. Locke, and upon such authority he had no difficulty in recommending
the plan to the encouragement of the legislature. Much might be effected
by a plan of this nature susceptible of constant improvement. Such a
plan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span> would convert the relief granted to the poor into an encouragement
to industry, instead of being, as it is by the present poor laws, a
premium to idleness and a school for sloth. There were also a number of
subordinate circumstances to which it was necessary to attend. The law
which prohibits giving relief where any visible property remains should
be abolished. That degrading condition should be withdrawn. No temporary
occasion should force a British subject to part with the last shilling
of his little capital, and compel him to descend to a state of
wretchedness from which he could never recover, merely that he might be
entitled to a casual supply. Another mode also of materially assisting
the industrious poor was, the advancing of small capitals, which might
be repaid in two or three years, while the person who repaid it would
probably have made an addition to his income. This might put him who
received them in the way of acquiring what might place him in a
situation to make permanent provision for himself. These were the
general ideas which had occurred to him upon the subject; if they should
be approved of by any gentleman in the House, they might perhaps appear
at a future time in a more accurate shape than he could pretend to give
them. He could not, however, let this opportunity slip without throwing
them out. He was aware that they would require to be very maturely
considered. He was aware also of a fundamental difficulty, that of
insuring the diligent execution of any law that should be enacted. This
could only be done by presenting to those who should be entrusted with
the execution motives to emulation, and by a frequent inspection of
their conduct as to diligence and fidelity. Were he to suggest an
outline, it would be this. To provide some new mode of inspection by
parishes, or by hundreds&mdash;to report to the magistrates at the petty
sessions, with a liberty of appeal from them to the general quarter
sessions, where the justice should be empowered to take cognizance of
the conduct of the different commissioners, and to remedy whatever
defects should be found to exist. That an annual report should be made
to parliament, and that parliament should impose upon itself the duty of
tracing the effect of its system from year to year, till it should be
fully matured. That there should be a standing order of the House for
this purpose, and in a word, that there should be an annual budget
opened, containing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span> details of the whole system of poor-laws, by
which the legislature would show that they had a constant and a watchful
eye upon the interests of the poorest and most neglected part of the
community. He was not vain enough to imagine that these ideas were the
result of his own investigations, but he was happy to say that they
arose from a careful examination of the subject, and an extensive survey
of the opinions of others. He would only add that it was a subject of
the utmost importance, and that he would do everything in his power to
bring forward or promote such measures as would conduce to the interest
of the country. He gave the hon. gentleman every possible credit for his
humane and laudable motives, yet seeing the subject in the light in
which he did, he was compelled to give his negative to the motion.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Lechmere</i> said, that the bill was not only founded in humanity, but
policy also. The late alarming scarcity ought to induce every man who
wished to encourage the industrious poor, to promote every plan of
relief for them at such a crisis. No agricultural labourer could at
present support himself and his family with comfort; for a barley loaf
was at the enormous price of 12&frac12;<i>d.</i>, while the whole of the
labourer's daily wages amounted to no more than one shilling. <i>Haud
ignara mali, miseris succurrere disco</i>, was a noble sentiment; but he
would rather have the labourer enjoy the honest fruits of his industry,
than be obliged to receive his due as an eleemosynary gift. It appeared
to him that the minimum of agricultural labour should be fixed.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Buxton</i> said, that the bill did not appear likely to be of much
service, for if the price of labour were to be fixed by the justices of
peace, he feared many industrious people would be thrown out of employ,
and become a burthen to their respective parishes. The people he alluded
to were those who by sickness or old age were rendered incapable of
doing so much as a common labourer, and who consequently would be
rejected for persons of more strength and activity. He had consulted
with various well informed farmers and gentlemen in Norfolk who
unanimously concurred in opinions that the bill would be injurious.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Vansittart</i> commended the hon. gentleman who introduced the bill,
for his humane intentions, but he had no hesitation in voting against
it, because he thought any arbitrary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span> regulations of the justices of the
peace, in the price of labour, would be a greater evil than that already
complained of. The bill appeared to him unnecessary, as the law since
the reign of James I, enabled the magistrate to fix the price of labour.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Burdon</i> did not think that the industrious poor were in that
wretched situation stated by some gentlemen. The industrious labourer,
in many instances, was able to support his family, and lay up something
for his old age. From the average price of labour for some years, the
House must perceive that the wages of the labourer were considerably
increased. The friendly societies, if they continued to extend, would be
productive of infinite good. As to the bill, he was convinced of its
inadequacy to correct the abuses of which it complained. He recommended
rather to repeal the act of Elizabeth than set it up as a precedent to
act upon.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Fox</i> said that no man was more against the idea of compulsion as to
the price of labour than he was. The question now was, not on the
general principle, but on that particular state of the law, which
rendered some measure necessary to be adopted for the relief of the
labouring poor, while the law, as it stood, was saddled with so many
restrictions. He approved of the bill proposed by his hon. friend, as
calculated to correct that which was bad in its present operation, and
to secure at least to the labourer the means of partial relief. But if
the House objected to the measure as improper, if they were of the
opinion that it was not the most judicious or desirable that might be
applied, he hoped they would go to the root of the evil, and provide
some remedy adequate to the extent of the grievance. If, therefore, they
should give a negative to the second reading of the bill, he should
consider that by so doing they pledged themselves to take the subject
into their early and most serious consideration. If what his hon. friend
had brought forward should induce the House to go into a full
examination of the subject, and to provide a remedy commensurate to the
evil, he would not only have accomplished his own benevolent intentions,
but would have done a much greater service to the country, than even if
the bill which he had now brought forward were adopted.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Whitbread</i> said:&mdash;"I cannot but congratulate the House on the able
and eloquent speech of the chancellor of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span> the exchequer. At the same
time I must remark that if the poor laws were actually such, as the
right hon. gentleman has stated they ought to be, it would not have been
necessary for me to have brought forward any proposition; but I am
afraid that facts and experience will be found undeniably to confirm my
assertion, that the poor in this country are in a state scarcely
consistent with the character of a civilised country. As to what the
right hon. gentleman has stated about the price of labour finding its
own level, he does not recollect that, till the level be found, the
industrious poor labour under the pressure of immediate suffering. If
the expedients he has proposed should succeed, they are matters of
future regulation, and not calculated to afford relief which the
exigencies of the times so imperiously demand. If it should be possible
to a considerable degree to promote industry among the children of the
poor, and to destroy the oppressive restrictions with respect to
settlements, still it will be a considerable time before the price of
labour will have found its level. Even if more effectual regulations
should afterwards be adopted, still this bill is eligible as a temporary
relief. It does not compel the magistrates to act: it only empowers them
to take measures according to the exigency of the times. It has been
stated as an objection to the bill, that it goes to fix the price of
labour, but gentlemen do not attend to the circumstances, that it does
not go to determine what should be the general price of labour, but only
what should be the least price of labour under particular circumstances.
As to the particular case of labourers, who have to provide for a number
of children, the wisest thing for government, instead of putting the
relief afforded to such on the footing of a charity, supplied, perhaps,
from a precarious fund, and dealt with a reluctant hand, would be at
once to institute a liberal premium for the encouragement of large
families. There is just one circumstance to which I shall advert, before
I conclude, namely, the wretched manner in which the poor are lodged. It
is such as ought not to be suffered in a country like this, proud of its
freedom, and boasting of the equal rights of all its subjects. The
landlord, who lets the ground upon lease to the farmer, does not
consider himself as bound to repair the cottages. The farmer, who has
only a temporary interest in the property, feels no anxiety on the
subject. The cottage, dismantled and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span> mouldering to decay, affords
neither warmth nor shelter to the poor inhabitant, who is left exposed
to the fury of the elements and the inclemency of every season. If a
negative should be put upon the second reading of the bill, I shall then
move for leave to bring in a bill to repeal the statute of Elizabeth,
and afterwards for a committee to take into consideration the state of
the poor laws."</p>

<p>The motion was negatived. After which, the bill was ordered to be read a
second time on that day three months.</p>

Journals, Vol. LIX, Feb. 22, 1804</i>], 1804.</p>

<p>A petition of several journeymen calico printers, and others working in
that trade, in the counties of Lancaster, Derby, Chester, and Stafford,
in England, and in the counties of Lanark, Renfrew, Dumbarton, Stirling,
and Perth in Scotland, was presented to the House, and read; setting
forth that great numbers of the petitioners and other journeymen calico
printers have, for a series of years past, been greatly distressed for
want of work in their trade, and that this distress has chiefly arisen
from a very general, if not universal, practice of the master calico
printers in the counties above enumerated, who systematically carry on
the said trade by employing in it, in many instances, a greater number
of out-door apprentices than of journeymen, and, upon an average, nearly
two of such apprentices to three journeymen, a practice of great injury
to the petitioners, their families, and, ultimately, even to the
apprentices themselves; and that one of the injurious effects, to the
petitioners by this system is, that, in many instances boys are taken as
apprentices to the said trade or business on verbal agreement, whereby
they are at liberty to absent themselves from the service and control of
their masters on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span> any trifling disagreement, and are generally replaced
by others, thereby creating an overstock of hands in the said trade: And
therefore praying, That leave may be given to bring in a bill to
regulate the trade or business of calico printers.</p>

<p>Ordered, that the said petition be referred to the consideration of a
committee.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">11. <a name="Report_on_Calico_Printers_Petition" id="Report_on_Calico_Printers_Petition"></a>Report on Calico Printers' Petition</span> [<i>Commons Journals,
Vol. LXI, July 17, 1806</i>], 1806.</p>

<p>Your committee have naturally endeavoured to ascertain the cause of
those discontents, and, as far as they have been able to collect from
the minutes of evidence referred to them, they find it has arisen
principally from the multiplication of apprentices. That this has gone
to an extent, and that the disproportion of apprentices to journeymen
exists to a degree, far beyond that understood to prevail in any other
mechanical profession whatever, appears to your committee in several
instances. In one instance, that of the shop of Berry and Co. of
Lancashire, they find that 55 apprentices were employed, and only two
journeymen; in another, that of the shop of Tod and Co. of Dumbarton,
there were 60 apprentices, and only two journeymen. Such a
disproportion, your committee conceive, must strike as extraordinary any
one in the least degree acquainted with the custom of trade.</p>

<p>The practice of introducing such an increased number of apprentices,
which commenced about the year 1790, does not appear from the minutes of
evidence to have proceeded from any scarcity of hands to supply the
demands of the masters, or make up the work required; on the contrary,
it appears that in the course of the period when this excessive
multiplication of apprentices went on, a number of journeymen were
seeking in vain for employment.</p>

<p>With regard to the multiplication of apprentices, while your committee
declare that they are not friendly to the idea of imposing any
restrictions upon trade, they are ready to state that the inclination of
their minds is this, that either all restrictions ought to be abolished,
and the masters and journeymen left to settle matters between
themselves, or an additional restriction ought to be introduced to
counteract the evils obviously resulting from the restrictions which
already exist. This restriction your committee mean of course to apply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
to apprentices; and if a precedent were wanted to justify such a
measure, they would refer to the case of the silk weavers, and that of
other trades, which are to be found on the Statute Book. In the instance
of the silk weavers, no more than two apprentices can be legally taken
by any master, whatever may be the number of his journeymen; and yet,
since the enactment of this law, no scarcity of hands has ever been
complained of in that flourishing branch of trade. Indeed, throughout
all the mechanical professions, it is, as far as has come to the
knowledge of any of the members of your committee, the general rule,
that no master shall have more than two or three apprentices at the
most. This general rule is conceived to be established through an
understanding between the masters and the journeymen.</p>

<p>The salutary effects of leaving the masters and journeymen to settle
their affairs between themselves, is particularly exemplified in the
calico printing business: for, although in Lancashire and Derbyshire,
etc., where there is nearly a proportion of one apprentice to one
journeyman, and between masters and journeymen a consequent jealousy,
productive of perpetual variance and confusion; there is in the
neighbourhood of London, where a different feeling prevails, and where
matters are amicably adjusted between the parties, a very different
proportion of apprentices and journeymen. In 14 shops examined by one of
the witnesses, in 1803, the number of journeymen were 216, the
apprentices only 37.</p>

<p>But to return to the subject of restrictions: your committee are
persuaded that as the Legislature has thought proper to interpose its
authority, to prevent the journeymen from concerting measures among
themselves to settle their affairs with the masters, it would be ready
to remove any complaints which might arise from advantage taken by the
masters of the existence of such restriction. The wisdom and humanity of
Parliament would shrink from sanctioning the Combination Law, if it
appeared to them, at the time of its enactment, likely to operate only
in favour of the strong, and against the weak; if it had any apparent
tendency to secure impunity to oppressors, and to give an undue
advantage to the masters, who can combine with little danger of
detection, and who can carry their projects into execution with little
fear of opposition. The Legislature could never mean to injure the man,
whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span> only desire is to derive a subsistence from his labour, and that
indeed is all a journeyman calico printer can look to; for, from the
particular nature of his trade, differing much from others, he cannot,
from the capital required, ever calculate upon becoming a master.</p>

4</span> [<i>Commons Journals, Vol. LXVIII, Feb. 25, 1813</i>], 1813.</p>

<p>A petition of several cotton weavers resident in the division of Bolton
Le Moors, in the county of Lancaster, was presented and read; setting
forth, that the petitioners are much concerned to learn that a bill has
been brought into the House to repeal so much of the Statute 5
Elizabeth, as empowers and requires the magistrates, in their respective
jurisdictions, to rate and settle the prices to be paid to labourers,
handicrafts, spinners, weavers, etc.; and that the petitioners have
endured almost constant reductions in the prices of their labour for
many years, with sometimes a trifling advance, but during the last
thirty months they have continued, with very little alteration, so low,
that the average wages of cotton weavers do not exceed 5<i>s.</i> per week,
though other trades in general earn from 20<i>s.</i> to 30<i>s.</i> per week; and
that the extravagant prices of provisions of all kinds render it
impossible for the petitioners to procure food for themselves and
families, and the parishes are so burthened that an adequate supply
cannot be had from that quarter; and that, in the 40th year of His
present Majesty a law was made to settle disputes between masters and
workmen<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>; which law having been found capable of evasion, and
evaded, became unavailing: after which, in 1802, 1803, and 1804,
applications being made to amend that of the 40th, another law was made,
varying in some points from the former; but this also is found
unavailing, inasmuch as no one conviction before a magistrate under this
law has ever been confirmed at any Quarter Sessions of the Peace; and
that several applications have since been made to the House to enact
such laws as they would judge suitable to afford relief to the trade, in
which masters and workmen joined, but hitherto without any effect; and
that, about twelve months since, it was found that the Statute of 5
Eliz. (if acted upon) was com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>petent to afford the desired relief, and
it was resorted to in certain cases, but the want of generality
prevented its obtaining at that time, especially as it can be acted on
only at the Easter Quarter Sessions, or six weeks thereafter; and that,
as petitions to the magistrates were almost general at the last Quarter
Sessions, and all graciously received at each different jurisdiction,
much hope was entertained that at the next Easter sessions the
magistrates would settle the wages of the petitioners, and they obtain
food by their industry; and that the present bill to repeal the
aforesaid law has sunk the spirits of the petitioners beyond
description, having no hope left: the former laws made for their
security being unavailing, there is no protection for their sole
property, which is their labour; and that, although the said law of 5
Eliz. was wisely designed to protect all trades and workmen, yet none
will essentially suffer by its repeal save the cotton weavers: the silk
weavers have law to secure their prices, as have other artizans;
tradesmen generally receive their contracted wages, but cotton weavers,
when their work is done, know not what they shall receive, as that
depends on the goodness of the employer's heart: And that the
petitioners, therefore, most humbly, and earnestly pray, that the House,
for the aforesaid reasons, will not repeal the said Statute of 5 Eliz.,
it being the only law by which they can hope any relief from their
present misery; and the existing laws being evaded, this would afford,
when acted upon, prices somewhat suitable to the prices of provisions in
adverse times; but should the House see it proper to repeal the said
law, the petitioners pray, that in that case it will enact a law to
secure and grant such wages to the petitioners as will enable them to
live by their industry, equally beneficial to masters and workmen.</p>

<p>Ordered, That the said Petition do lie upon the Table.</p>

1813-1814.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apprentices.</span>&mdash;<i>Mr. Rose</i> adverted to the petition<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> he
presented the other day, which was signed by above 800 masters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span> and
13,000 journeymen in London; and by 1,154 masters and 17,517 journeymen
in the country; making above 32,000 in all. The policy of the system
began in Edward the 3rd. Some had doubted the effects of the law, and
deemed all restrictions injurious to commerce: others considered the
want of restrictions more dangerous, and contended that the present
system had encouraged habits of industry. The courts had, in general,
narrowed the spirit and application of the restrictions. He thought that
if the existing law was not to be enforced, it ought to be amended or
repealed. A petition signed by such a number of tradesmen was deserving
the most attentive consideration. He should therefore move that the
petition be referred to a committee.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Serjeant Onslow</i> allowed that the number of signatures to the
petition entitled it to a respectful consideration. As to the
allegations of the petition, he thought it very extraordinary that the
petitioners should really expect that parliament would allow them to
bring actions upon this statute, against whom they pleased, well-founded
or ill-founded, without being subject to costs in case of failure. From
his experience in a certain judicial situation, he could say, and he
believed he might appeal to all his professional friends about him for
the confirmation of his statement, that he never knew any indictment
brought under this statute except against a person of great skill and
acquirements. The preamble of the Act stated its object to be "to
prevent the introduction of unskilful workmen": and yet no indictments
were ever brought against unskilful workmen, but only against very
skilful and ingenious men. This shewed pretty clearly the spirit in
which such prosecutions were brought.</p>

<p><i>Mr. D. Giddy</i> said, that he should not vote for the committee, if he
did not think it likely that the resolution they would come to would be
directly opposite to that which was expected by the petitioners. He
certainly did entertain great doubts, whether in the present state of
the commercial world there was any use in those apprenticeships,
although they might have been necessary in the infancy of commerce. It
frequently happened, that a young man had not a talent for that
particular business to which he had been bound an apprentice, and was
yet possessed of other talents, by the exercise of which he might obtain
a most respectable subsistence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span> It appealed to him a cruel hardship to
fetter the minds and limbs of men, so as to prevent their obtaining a
subsistence by the fair exercise of their talents and of their limbs. As
to what was said of corporate rights, obtained by apprenticeship, he
thought that made it the less necessary to add penalties. If those
corporate rights, however, were to be considered of real value, he
thought it a great hardship that they could not be obtained in any other
way than by serving an apprenticeship.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Butterworth</i> also felt inclined to disapprove of the Act as highly
injurious to trade in general, and to rising talent. In illustration of
the hardships of the Act, and of the manner in which it was generally
enforced, he mentioned a case which had come within his own immediate
observation. In an office of which he had the command, there was a young
man of great skill, and consequently of great value to his employers;
he, however, had not served the regular apprenticeship, and his
fellow-workmen therefore combined against him, demanding his discharge.
He (Mr. B.) interfered on behalf of the young man, but in vain; for the
conspiracy amongst the workmen attained that height that their request
was obliged to be complied with. The young man was discharged, and
though skilful in that particular trade, he had been compelled to sell
the furniture, the produce of his industry, to support a wife and
family, who were dependent on him for support. He did not oppose the
committee, because he was convinced that the determination would be in
favour of the repeal of the 5th of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The petition was then referred to a committee.</p>


<p class='center'><i>Wednesday, April 6, 1814.</i><a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apprentice Laws.</span>&mdash;<i>Mr. H. Davis</i> presented a petition from
certain master manufacturers of the city of Bristol, praying that so
much of the Act of the 5th of Elizabeth, cap. 4, as inflicted penalties
on persons exercising trades to which they had not served regular
apprenticeships, should be repealed. Ordered to lie on the table.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P. Moore</i> presented a petition from the manufacturers of Coventry,
praying that that part of the 5th of Elizabeth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span> cap. 4, which inflicted
penalties on persons exercising trades to which they had not served
regular apprenticeships, should be rendered efficient. He should merely
move "that the petition do lie on the table"; but, before he sat down,
he wished to enquire of the learned gentleman (Mr. Serjeant Onslow) who
had given notice of his intention to introduce a Bill on the subject,
whether he meant, in his proposed measure, to confine himself merely to
the repeal of that part of the 5th of Elizabeth which sanctioned those
penalties, or to do away with the Act altogether? He also wished to know
whether the learned gentleman intended to push his Bill through the
different stages in the present session; or, having introduced it, to
let it lie over till the next? In his opinion a committee ought to be
appointed, in the first instance, to examine the whole of the petitions
that had been presented relative to the 5th of Elizabeth, and also to
look into the provisions of that Act.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Serjeant Onslow</i> said, most unquestionably he did not mean to go
beyond the terms of his notice, in the measure he should introduce. He
had stated explicitly the part of the Act that he wished to have
repealed, and he had not since altered his determination. With respect
to the second point of the hon. gentleman's interrogatory, "Whether he
intended to hurry the Bill through the House?" he would answer that he
certainly did not. But the hon. gentleman seemed to forget that the
present period was virtually almost the commencement of the session, and
that very important business was yet to come on. He (Serjeant Onslow)
certainly did wish to have the sense of the House taken on the Bill,
before the session terminated. And this, he thought, could be done
without any imputation of hurry. In the last session the Treasurer of
the Navy (Mr. Rose) had presented a petition from a great number of
persons who were desirous that the penalties should be continued; and
moved for a committee to investigate the allegations of the petitioners.
A committee was granted&mdash;it sat from day to day&mdash;and the evidence
adduced before it was printed. He (Serjeant Onslow) enquired of that
right hon. gentleman whether he intended to found any motion on this
evidence? And, understanding that he did not, he stated, at the close of
the last session, that he would himself submit a motion on the subject.
Soon after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span> parliament met he gave notice of a motion for the 30th of
November; but, in consequence of a number of gentlemen who represented
large manufacturing districts (particularly the hon. member for
Yorkshire) not being then in town, he postponed it till the 22nd of
February, and had finally put it off till the 27th of the present
month&mdash;knowing that a call of the House would take place before that
period, which would ensure a full attendance when the proposed measure
came to be discussed. That the country was not unprepared for it, was
evident from the numerous petitions which had been presented in favour
of it. Petitions of that nature had been received from Leeds,
Birmingham, Huddersfield, Bristol, and many other populous
neighbourhoods. Several petitions had been presented against it. How
they were procured he did not know; but the language in all of them
appeared nearly the same. With respect to the principal trade carried on
by the constituents of the hon. gentleman, it would not be at all
affected by the new Bill, because it was already guarded by a variety of
enactments totally independent of the 5th of Elizabeth.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P. Moore</i> said it was very true that his constituents (the freemen
of Coventry) were obliged by Act of Parliament to serve a regular
apprenticeship, before they could carry on the business alluded to by
the learned gentleman. Now they were alarmed lest by the proposed Bill
they should be deprived of a right which they had long enjoyed. They
therefore were anxious that the Bill should not be hurried through the
House.</p>

<p>The petition was ordered to lie on the table.</p>

<p class='center'><i>Wednesday, April 27, 1814.</i><a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apprenticeship Laws.</span>&mdash;<i>Mr. Serjeant Onslow</i> rose to move for
leave to bring in a Bill to repeal part of an Act, passed in the 5th
year of Elizabeth, entitled "An Act containing divers orders for
artificers, labourers, servants of husbandry, and apprentices." ... The
reign of Queen Elizabeth, though glorious, was not one in which sound
principles of commerce were known; and a perusal of the other clauses of
the Act, as well as the one creating the penalties for exercising trades
contrary to its provisions, would fully confirm that assertion;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span> indeed
it did not seem to be the object of that statute to favour manufactures;
it rather seemed to be intended to make them subservient to a most
mistaken notion of favour to the landed interest. So little was
political economy then understood that the idea never seemed to have
occurred, that agriculture was best promoted by the prosperity of
commerce and manufactures; and that restraints on them defeated the end
they aimed at, and discouraged that very employment which they ought to
promote.... Apprenticeships had been looked upon as favourable to the
morals of youth, and he was very far from wishing to discourage them;
but he did not wish them to be an indispensable qualification for
legally carrying on trades.... Apprenticeships were as common in trades
not within the statute as in those that were within what had been called
the protection, but what he thought the curse, of the statute....</p>

<p><i>Mr. Philips.</i>&mdash;The persons most competent to form regulations with
respect to trade were the master manufacturers, whose interest it was to
have goods of the best fabric; and no legislative enactment could ever
effect so much in producing that result, as the merely leaving things to
their own course and operation. The proof of this was to be found in the
fact that the manufactures for which the country was most famous, were
precisely those to which this Act did not apply. If this narrow
principle had been carried into every branch of art, the machinery of
Sir Richard Arkwright would have been lost to the country&mdash;and the
genius of Mr. Watt, whose inventions had added more to the productive
powers of the empire, than if the population had been increased one
half, would have been still unknown. The hon. gentleman then proceeded
to point out the evil effects which arose from the system of combination
among tradesmen [workmen].</p>

<p>Leave was given to bring in the Bill.</p>

<p class='center'><i>Friday, May 13, 1814.</i><a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apprentice Laws.</span>&mdash;<i>Mr. Serjeant Onslow</i> moved the second
reading of the Bill, which was warmly opposed by <i>Sir Fred. Flood</i>, who,
though a friend to liberty, disliked licentiousness. The Bill went to
abrogate that most salutary law of the 5th of Elizabeth, and to revive
the practice which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span> had previously existed from Edward the Third's time.
It would be destructive of the interests of persons who served their
apprenticeships, and paid for education in their respective trades, and
ruinous to the morals of youth. It would be hurtful to commerce, to
mechanics, to manufacture and to the Stamp Act. The present law had
lasted 220 years. He proposed to postpone the second reading to that day
six months.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Protheroe</i> seconded the motion, as the Bill proceeded on no general
comprehensive system, but simply on a repeal without any efficient
substitute for what was to be repealed. He objected to the measure in a
moral point of view; in which respect he was upheld by the opinions of
Lord Coke and Sir Wm. Blackstone. He had heard much of vexatious
prosecutions under the Act of Elizabeth; but, on enquiry, he found that
at Bristol for the last 20 years, there had not been one such
prosecution. If apprenticeships were more encouraged, he was satisfied
that combinations among journeymen would almost entirely be put an end
to. If the House were to lower its attention down to the humble cottage,
they would there see the advantages of this system, in beholding careful
masters provided for the youths, who, in addition, were provided with
food and clothing, while their morals were protected. He should be happy
that the present Bill were withdrawn, and some measure unaccompanied by
its disadvantages were introduced.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Hart Davis</i> could not disguise from himself that the present
measure was attended with many difficulties. It would undoubtedly be of
great advantage to our manufacturers that the present law should be
repealed, and that every restraint should be removed from the rising
generation. Supposing a person brought up to a trade for which from his
constitution he was not fit, was he to be excluded from pursuing any
other pursuit, or occupation whatever? Suppose the trade of
button-makers, which was a trade that speedily passed away; or of
gun-makers, of whom probably 40,000 might be in a few months thrown out
of employment, was it to be held that they could follow no other
occupation, but must remain a burden upon the community? The more he
considered the present measure, the more he was satisfied of its
utility.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Protheroe</i> explained that he could wish a general review of the
whole system.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Giddy</i> thought if any one measure more than another could be said
to involve the general rights of mankind, the present was that measure.
What was this but the general right of the inhabitants of this country
to employ the energies of their mind and body in the way they themselves
pleased? And if a system were to be continued by which men were deprived
of this general and undoubted right, it seemed to be incumbent on those
who contended for the continuance of such a restriction to shew on what
principle it was founded. If gentlemen attended to the time in which the
law in question was passed, they would find it was a period in which
many ill-advised monopolies had been granted, and one in which
remonstrances on that subject had been made by the House of Commons on
the impolicy of such a system, which had not been much attended to.
Nothing, he was convinced, had contributed so much as the law in
question to check the progress in our arts and manufactures.</p>

<p><i>Sir C. Mordaunt</i>, on the part of his constituents, the manufacturers of
Birmingham, was strongly in favour of the present repeal. If the law, as
it now stood, were put in force, it would have the effect of imposing
the strongest possible fetters upon ingenuity and industry.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Thompson</i> liked liberty; and doing so, he wished to see every man
have the liberty of employing his hands and his genius in the best way
he could to his own advantage, and for the benefit of the country. This
no man was at liberty to do, so long as the present law remained in
force. He wished the law totally repealed, though the Bill did not go so
far. The present law was necessarily broken every day. It was clear that
the judges always wished to evade it, when they could do so. He knew a
case of two men who were prosecuted under the Act for sawing a piece of
wood; another, of a good and bad baker in the same town; where the bad
one, finding that the good one had not served a regular apprenticeship,
had him turned out, and got liberty to poison all his neighbours with
his bad bread. Some years ago the printers struck, and there was a
difficulty in getting even the parliamentary papers printed. Let those
who chose it bind their children as apprentices; but let not others be
compelled to do the same.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span> Instances of the absurdity of the law would
be innumerable. It was none the better for the age of it, which the
worthy baronet had stated. It was, in fact, superannuated; and it was
much the kindest way to let it die quietly, and so confer an advantage
both on the country and Ireland. Lord Ellenborough once got the
coach-makers out of a scrape ingeniously enough. They were attacked as
wheelmakers; but his lordship said that coaches could not have been
known in Elizabeth's days, as that queen went to parliament on
horseback. He perfectly agreed in the opinion which Lord Mansfield had
given, in speaking of the Act of Elizabeth, that "it was against the
natural rights of man, and contrary to the common law rights of the
land."</p>

<p><i>Mr. Rose</i> considered this as a subject of extraordinary difficulty.
After all that had been said, he could not help thinking that if the
Bill were passed into law, it would put an end to apprenticeships
altogether; for no person would subject himself to a seven years'
servitude when he knew that having fulfilled his indenture, he would
only be on a level with a man who perhaps had not been one year at the
business. He was willing to examine and improve the 5th of Elizabeth,
but would not agree to this unqualified repeal.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Newport</i> was surprised that the hon. baronet (Sir F. Flood)
should be so anxious to perpetuate a statute which never was law in
Ireland; and yet in that country, where no such penalties as those
inflicted by the 5th of Elizabeth existed, the system of apprenticeships
was freely and voluntarily adopted. He thought, on every principle of
justice, that the subject was entitled to make use of his abilities and
industry in those pursuits most beneficial to his interests.</p>

<p><i>Sir S. Romilly</i> had been applied to on the subject of the present Bill,
by the constituents of two hon. gentlemen who had already delivered
their sentiments on the measure this night (Messrs. Protheroe and
Davis). He felt the highest respect for the gentlemen who had so applied
to him on the subject of the present Bill; but his opinion of the
measure being decidedly opposite to theirs, he thought he should not be
acting a manly part were he either to abstain from voting on the Bill,
or were he to content himself with a silent vote on this occasion. He
was satisfied that there were reasons sufficiently strong to support the
system of apprenticeships<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span> in those trades in which a number of years
were requisite to the acquiring a knowledge of them, without the
assistance of the law as it now stood. This law, which went to prohibit
a man from the exercise of that trade for which he was fit, he therefore
thought ought to be repealed. For what was it but to take from a poor
man the only property he possessed&mdash;his genius and industry&mdash;and to
drive him into a workhouse; or to force him to abandon his country, and
to forsake his wife and family. These were the moral consequences which
the House was to look for from a perseverance in the law as it now
stood.</p>

<p><i>Alderman Atkins</i> hoped that some clause might be introduced into the
Bill when it was in the committee, that would give sufficient
encouragement to the apprentice system; while, at the same time, the
abuses of it might be remedied.</p>

<p><i>Sir F. Flood</i>, seeing the sense of the House against him, withdrew his
amendment.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Canning</i> wished the Bill to go into the committee. He was aware
that the subject was attended with considerable difficulties. The
difficulty would be to find the means of doing away the abuses
complained of, without doing away the system altogether, which he was
convinced was useful to the perfection of our manufactures, and still
more useful as affecting the morality of the lower orders.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Serjeant Best</i> said that if no other member introduced a clause to
that effect, he himself should feel it his duty to propose one. He
thought the penal clauses of the Act of Elizabeth should certainly be
repealed, but that at the same time it was much better that young people
should not be left without some control. He thought that at present the
masters had much more advantages from the services of the apprentices,
than the apprentices had from the instruction of the master, as most of
those trades might be learned in a very short time. He therefore wished
that part of the earnings might go to the parents, as an encouragement
to the system.</p>

<p><i>Mr. P. Moore</i> opposed the Bill, because he thought that its enactment
would operate seriously to the prejudice of our manufactures both in
skill and reputation. Indeed, such had been found the effect of the
partial repeal of the statute of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span> Elizabeth with respect to the woollen
manufacture.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> For although the Yorkshire tag had formerly been a
sufficient recommendation upon the continent, yet since the repeal
alluded to, our pieces of woollen manufactures were examined yard by
yard before they were purchased.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Lockhart</i> expressed his opinion, that this Bill, if enacted, should
only operate prospectively; that is, that it should not become effective
until a certain period; so that those mechanics who had served
apprenticeships upon the faith of the existing law, should not be
injured by its operation, by being thrown out of employment at a period
of life when they could not devote themselves to any other profession
than that to which they had been reared.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B. Shaw</i> deprecated the idea that morality was likely to be
endangered, or our manufactures injured, by the enactment of the Bill
under consideration; for Scotland, to which the Act of Elizabeth never
extended, was never found in any degree inferior in morality or skill in
manufacture.</p>

<p><i>Mr. W. Smith</i> observed, that he never heard of any proposition of
reform which was not likely to be inconvenient to some persons; and
therefore he was not surprised at the assertion, that the adoption of
the Bill before the House would operate to injure the interests of
particular persons. The apprehension of such injury was, however, in his
judgment, unfounded. But still, those who expressed the apprehension
were entitled to attention; and the objections which certain petitioners
urged against this Bill, would, he had no doubt, meet all due
consideration in the committee. The fact was, as to the statute of
Elizabeth, that its existence served to create monopolies; and the
effect of those monopolies was, that when the demand for an article was
large, the price was enhanced to the public; while, when the demand
became small, many workmen were thrown out of employment. Therefore, the
repeal of that statute would tend to serve both the public and the
workmen. As to the argument advanced in support of the statute of
Elizabeth, merely in consequence of its antiquity, he could not admit
that it had any force. He declared that his ears were quite tired of the
phrase "the wisdom of our ancestors," which phrase was, in fact,
calculated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span> only to impose upon the superficial. For, after all, what
did this phrase mean? The world was younger in the time of our
ancestors, although they were older than us. Time, Lord Bacon said, was
the greatest innovator; and if, at this advanced time of the world,
after all our experience, we could not improve upon the system of our
ancestors, our intellects must be what would hardly be asserted, not
only quite unequal to theirs, but infinitely inferior. How, then, could
it be pretended, that the same legislative arrangements applied in the
reign of Elizabeth, when the trade of the whole British Empire was not
equal to that of the port of London at this day, was strictly applicable
at present, and suited to our improved situation?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Serjeant Onslow</i> replied, and, observing upon the petitions on the
table against the Bill, expressed his conviction that they were not the
unsolicited acts of the petitioners; as indeed appeared from several
placards about town, inviting signatures to such petitions; and those
petitioners, he meant especially the journeymen mechanics, would find
the repeal of the Act of Elizabeth rather materially serviceable, than
in any degree injurious to their interests.</p>

<p>The Bill was read a second time, and ordered to be committed on Tuesday.</p>

Geo. III. 96, 1814.]</p>

of Committee on Petitions of the Watchmakers, 1817 (VI)</i>], 1817.</p>

<p>1. That the obvious intention of our ancestors, in enacting the statute
of the 5 Elizabeth, cap. 4, was to produce and maintain a competent
number and perpetual succession of masters and journeymen, of practical
experience, to promote, secure, and render permanent the prosperity of
the national arts and manufactures, honestly wrought by their ability
and talents, inculcated by a mechanical education, called a seven years'
apprenticeship; whereby according to the memorable words of the statute
itself "it will come to pass, that the same law (being duly executed)
should banish idleness, advance husbandry, and yield unto the hired
person, both in time of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span> scarcity and in time of plenty, a convenient
proportion of wages."</p>

<p>2. That it is by apprenticeships, that the practitioners in the arts and
manufactures attain the high degree of perfection, whereby British
productions have arrived at the great estimation in which they were
heretofore held in foreign markets.</p>

<p>8. That the apprenticed artisans have, collectively and individually, an
unquestionable right to expect the most extended protection from the
Legislature, in the quiet and exclusive use and enjoyment of their
several and respective arts and trades, which the law has already
conferred upon them as a property, as much as it has secured the
property of the stockholder in the public funds; and it is clearly
unjust to take the whole of the ancient established property and rights
of any one class of the community, unless, at the same time, the rights
and property of the whole commonwealth should be dissolved, and
parcelled out anew for the public good.</p>

<p>10. That in consequence of too minute a division of labour,
injudiciously allowed in several manufactures, the workmen employed are
not enabled to make throughout any one article however simple, or even
to maintain themselves by their industry.</p>

<p>11. That the unlimited or promiscuous introduction of various
descriptions of persons without apprenticeship into the manufactures
occasions a surplus of manufacturing poor, and an unnecessary
competition, ruinous to the commercial capital and industry of the
nation; because the overflow of goods causes all the productions of the
manufacturies to fall in price, and be sold to foreigners for less money
than they cost in making; which deficiencies are necessarily made up by
the ruin of the master manufacturers, bankruptcies, and dividends to
creditors; and are the cause of increased parochial and other rates,
thus necessarily created, for the support of the poor workmen, who are
deprived of the fair price of their honest labour.</p>

<p>17. That the system of apprenticeships, whether considered in a
religious, political or moral point of view, is highly beneficial to the
State, and from the neglect thereof is to be attributed the great
defalcation of public morals, the numerous frauds committed in trade,
the increased numbers of juvenile criminals, public trials and
executions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span></p>

<p>18. That the pretensions to the allowance of universal uncontrolled
freedom of action to every individual founded upon the same delusive
theoretical principles which fostered the French Revolution, are wholly
inapplicable to the insular situation of this Kingdom, and if allowed to
prevail, will hasten the destruction of the social system so happily
arranged in the existing form and substance of the British constitution,
established by law.</p>

<p>19. That the meeting highly approves the proceedings of the 62,875
masters and journeymen, who have already presented petitions, to the
House of Commons, praying for leave to bring a Bill into Parliament to
amend, extend and make more effectual the statute of apprenticeship, 5
Elizabeth, chap. 4.</p>

<p>21. That the most effectual preventive against and check upon
combinations of journeymen, as also of masters in any trade, is for the
persons engaged in such trades to take apprentices as required by law.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">15. <a name="Report_of_Committee_on_the_Ribbon_Weavers" id="Report_of_Committee_on_the_Ribbon_Weavers"></a>Report of Committee on the Ribbon Weavers</span> [<i>Report of
Committee on the Ribbon Weavers, 1818 (IX)</i>], 1818.</p>

<p>Your Committee also report, That it appears by the examination that the
silk, and ribbon weavers in particular, are and have been for some time
past suffering great privations and distress, arising out of inadequate
wages; that such distress has had the effect of reducing thousands of
them to seek parochial aid, and have, in consequence, increased the
poor-rate, especially in the parishes of Coventry and in the County of
Warwick, where the ribbon trade is the staple manufacture, to an extent
too burdensome to be much longer borne.</p>

<p>That the low rate of wages complained of by the Petitioners is not in
consequence of the want of trade, it having been proved to your
committee that there are as many silk goods, particularly ribbons, now
making, as at any former time.</p>

<p>That a system of half-pay apprenticeship has been resorted to, which has
been attended with ruinous consequences to the morals of such
apprentices, and exceedingly injurious to the trade.</p>

<p>That the evils complained of do not exist in London, Westminster, and
Middlesex; which your committee believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span> to be owing to the provisions
of the act called the Spitalfields Act, which extend to those places,
the effects of which are fully detailed in the evidence.</p>

<p>That the whole of the masters and weavers in the Ribbon Trade concur in
the propriety of an extension of the Spitalfields Act.</p>

<p>Your Committee are, therefore, of opinion, that it is absolutely
necessary, for the protection of the weavers in the silk trade, and the
ribbon trade in particular, and to enable them to support themselves and
families, and also for protecting the parishes in which these trades are
carried on, that some legislative interference should take place; and
your committee think that a remedy could be found in the extension of
the provisions of the Spitalfields and Dublin Acts, or at least a trial
of that extension for a period of a few years, by way of experiment.</p>

<p>Your committee cannot but remark, that whilst the Statute of 5th
Elizabeth, c. 4, was in force, that the distressing circumstances now
complained of, never occurred.</p>

the West Indies, should, at least for a few moments, have sojourned in
our immediate neighbourhood, and have directed the attention of the
meeting to scenes of misery, acts of oppression and victims of Slavery,
even on the threshold of our homes!</p>

<p>Let the truth speak out, appalling as the statements may appear. The
fact is true. Thousands of our fellow-creatures and fellow-subjects,
both male and female, the inhabitants of a <i>Yorkshire-town</i>, (Yorkshire
now represented in Parliament by the giant of anti-slavery
principles,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>) are at this very moment existing in a state of slavery
<i>more horrid</i> than are the victims of that hellish system&mdash;"<i>Colonial
Slavery.</i>" These innocent creatures drawl out unpitied their short but
miserable existence, in a place famed for its profession of religious
zeal, whose inhabitants are ever foremost in <i>professing</i> "Temperance"
and "Reformation," and are striving to outrun their neighbours in
Missionary exertions, and would fain send the Bible to the farthest
corner of the Globe&mdash;aye in the very place where the anti-slavery fever
rages most furiously, her <i>apparent charity</i> is not more admired on
earth, than her <i>real</i> cruelty is abhorred in heaven. The very streets
which receive the droppings of an "Anti-Slavery Society" are every
morning wet with the tears of innocent victims at the accursed shrine of
avarice, who are compelled (not by the cart-whip of the negro
slave-driver) but by the dread of the equally appalling thong or strap
of the overlooker, to hasten half-dressed, <i>but not half-fed</i>, to those
magazines of British Infantile Slavery&mdash;<i>the Worsted Mills in the town
and neighbourhood of Bradford</i>!!!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Thousands of little children, both male and female, <i>but principally
female</i>, from <span class="smcap">SEVEN</span> to fourteen years, are daily <i>compelled</i> to
<i>labour</i> from six o'clock in the morning to seven in the evening with
only&mdash;Britons, blush whilst you read it!&mdash;<i>with only thirty minutes
allowed for eating and recreation</i>.</p>

<p>The Blacks may be fairly compared to beasts of burden <i>kept for their
master's use</i>. The whites to those <i>which others keep and let for
hire</i>! If I have succeeded in calling the attention of your readers to
the horrid and abominable system on which the worsted mills in and near
Bradford are conducted, I have done some good. Why should not children
working in them be protected by legislative enactments, as well as those
who work in cotton mills. Christians should feel and act for those whom
Christ so eminently loved and declared that "of such is the kingdom of
heaven."</p>

Report from Committee on Hand-loom Weavers' Petitions, 1834 (X), pp.
48-9</i>], 1834.</p>


<p class='center'><i>Evidence of Hugh Mackenzie, June 28, 1834.</i></p>

<p>Have the goodness to explain to the Committee ... what are the boards of
trade for which you have sent up petitions to the House?</p>

<p>We have endeavoured upon many occasions to make this system of a board
of trade, which we pray for, as well understood as possible.... Now the
old Spitalfields Act every one that is not friendly to the present
proposed plans of boards of trade never fails to bring forward as an
objection, as a thing which has been practically tried and failed. There
is, however, nothing more different. The Spitalfields Act carried its
own ruin in its constitution; it was framed upon the principle of being
local, and confined to one place only. It was impossible that such an
act could stand long, for whilst competition went on in the country,
other manufacturers who were only at ten miles distance, or anywhere
where the act did not extend, were at liberty to set up the same kind of
work, and pay for it, without any transgression of the law, at a great
reduction. This being the case, the trade of Spitalfields then began to
spread to different parts of the country where the act did not extend;
the consequence was, that Spitalfields was soon undersold by cheaper
goods than it could make itself, and this led to the ruin of the
Spitalfields Act. But had the thing been made general, and extended over
the whole nation, the towns in the neighbourhood could not have
underwrought Spitalfields; they would have been on the same footing. Had
that act been made general, it would have been very good for the country
at large; not the fixed price that the Spitalfields Act contained, but
the minimum, the lowest price; it might rise and fall according to the
circumstances of the trade. Now our views of it are exactly and
principally founded upon that; a board of trade that shall extend over
the whole nation, and that it shall be under one superintending head. We
suppose that that superintending head could be nothing short of His
Majesty's Board of Trade in London, and that boards of trade in local<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
places in the country, who are only branches, locally established, not
to do as themselves pleased, but they are to be all subordinate to one
general board: that these boards shall be at all times guided by the
circumstances of the times; and that this data, or lowest minimum of
price, shall be taken from what the manufacturer or manufacturers of
respectability are able and willing to pay, provided that others were
obliged to pay the same prices with him, and that he could not be
undersold in the market: that the foreign trade shall by no means be
excluded from the consideration of the board; they are to be taken into
consideration whether it is expedient that the prices shall be brought
down a little, or up a little, just as the nature of trade might
require....</p>

<p>Have you any parties introduced in these boards of trade consisting of
masters and workmen, who would belong to neither party, who would act in
conjunction with them in arbitrating where there was a difference of
opinion whether the master paid too little or too much wages? Yes, we
had conceived that the self-interest of both parties might induce them
to differ, supposing an equal number of manufacturers and weavers
composed this board; and one party under such circumstances must of
course be in the wrong. Now the only arbiter that could be brought forth
under such circumstances must be a neutral, that was pretty well versed
in the nature of trade, and that arbitrator could be none other than His
Majesty's Board of Trade in London.</p>

<p>In Glasgow or anywhere in Scotland, have you a board of trade in
operation upon the principles you approve of, that you think would
answer all purposes? It is going on just now; it is working at Paisley
very finely, and at Glasgow.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Just explain those principles as far as you can? The working of the
Paisley board at the present time, and the working of the Glasgow board,
are exactly upon the same principles. The principle is this, that for
all the species of work made at Paisley, the manufacturers made out a
table of prices, and the weavers made out another; they were
reciprocally handed to each other for correction, and the result was,
they came to a mutual agreement; they entered into a 12 months'
agreement, that they would issue no more work out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span> to their workmen
below the minimum price fixed, say it was 1s. for a certain fabric.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

Second Report, 1835 (XIII), p. 14.
</p><p>
"The principal feature of Mr. Fielden's Bill is, that returns shall be
made every three or six months of the prices of weaving paid by the
smallest number of manufacturers, who collectively made one-half of the
goods of any description in the parish or township whence the returns
are sent, and the average of the highest prices paid by a majority of
such manufacturers, shall be the lowest price to be paid in such parish
or township during the succeeding three or six months. The effects of
the measure would be to withdraw from the worst-paying masters the power
which they now possess of regulating wages, and to confer it upon those
whose object it is to raise the condition and character of the
workpeople."</p></div>

wages ... at or within any tavern, public house, beer shop, or other

<p>21. <span class="smcap"><a name="Debate_on_Factory_Legislation" id="Debate_on_Factory_Legislation"></a>Debate on Factory Legislation</span> [<i>Parliamentary Debates, 3rd
Series, Vol. 73, Cols. 1073-1151</i>], 1844.</p>

<p>Hours of Labour in Factories. House of Commons in Committee on the
Factories Bill. March 15, 1844.</p>

<p><i>Lord Ashley</i> rose to propose the amendment of which he had given
notice&mdash;</p>

<p>"That, the word 'night' shall be taken to mean from six o'clock in the
evening to six o'clock in the following morning; and the word 'mealtime'
shall be taken to mean an interval of cessation from work for the
purpose of rest and refreshment, at the rate of two hours a day, with a
view to effect a limitation of the hours of labour to ten in the day."</p>

<p>The form of my amendment (said the noble Lord) requires some preliminary
explanation. I move it in its present shape at the suggestion of my
right hon. friend and the Government, though I fear that in adopting
that course I subject myself to some disadvantage. The House will allow
me at the outset to explain my amendment. I propose that the word
"night," in this clause shall be taken to mean from six o'clock in the
evening till six on the following morning, that will leave twelve clear
hours during which work shall cease, and I propose further, that out of
the twelve hours of day, there shall be two hours during which there
shall be a cessation of labour; but that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span> no person shall be affected by
this amendment, except those who, under clause ten, are guaranteed
against night-work, children, and young persons under thirteen years of
age. If I succeed in this amendment it will be necessary to make some
corresponding alteration in the eighth clause. The tenth clause I
propose to leave, as that will afford an opportunity of giving some
relaxation through the summer months. During the winter months, that is
from the 15th of October to the 15th of March, hours of labour are not
to exceed ten, two being for meals; but during the summer months, that
is from the 15th of March to the 15th of October, the hours to be twelve
and two for meals, making fourteen in the whole. Now, I would say with a
view to conciliate opposition, that though I shall be ready to propose,
as I intend to do, to limit the labour of all young persons and children
to ten hours in each day, I am yet willing to obtain that object in
parts and by degrees; that is, I propose to limit the hours of labour
for such persons to eleven hours a day from the 1st of October in the
present year, and ten hours a day from the 1st of October, 1845. Nearly
eleven years have now elapsed since I first made the proposition to the
House which I shall renew this night. Never, at any time, have I felt
greater apprehension or even anxiety; not through any fear of personal
defeat, for disappointment is "the badge of all our tribe;" but because
I know well the hostility that I have aroused, and the certain issues of
indiscretion on my part affecting the welfare of those who have so long
confided their hopes and interests to my charge.</p>

<p>And here let me anticipate the constant, but unjust, accusation that I
am animated by a peculiar hostility against factory masters, and I have
always selected them as exclusive objects of attack. I must assert that
the charge, though specious, is altogether untrue. I began, I admit,
this public movement by an effort to improve the condition of the
factories; but this I did, not because I ascribed to that department of
industry a monopoly of all that was pernicious and cruel, but because it
was then before the public eye, comprised the wealthiest and most
responsible proprietors, and presented the greatest facilities for
legislation.</p>

<p>As soon as I had the power, I showed my impartiality by moving the House
for the Children's Employment Commission. The curious in human suffering
may decide on the respective<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span> merits of the several reports; but factory
labour has no longer an unquestionable pre-eminence of ill fame; and we
are called upon to give relief, not because it is the worst system, but
because it is oppressive, and yet capable of alleviation. Sir, I confess
that ten years of experience have taught me that avarice and cruelty are
not the peculiar and inherent qualities of any one class or
occupation&mdash;they will ever be found where the means of profit are
combined with great and, virtually, irresponsible power&mdash;they will be
found wherever interest and selfishness have a purpose to serve, and a
favourable opportunity.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This will conclude the statement that I have to make to the House&mdash;and
now, sir, who will assert that these things should be permitted to
exist? Who will hesitate to apply the axe to the root of the tree, or,
at least, endeavour to lop off some of its deadliest branches? What
arguments from general principles will they adduce against my
proposition? What, drawn from peculiar circumstances? They cannot urge
that particular causes in England give rise to particular results; the
same cause prevails in various countries; and wherever it is found, it
produces the same effects. I have already stated its operation in
France, in Russia, in Switzerland, in Austria, and in Prussia; I may add
also in America; for I perceive by the papers of the 1st of February,
that a Bill has been proposed in the Legislature of Pennsylvania, to
place all persons under the age of sixteen within the protection of the
"ten hours" limit. I never thought that we should have learned justice
from the City of Philadelphia. In October last I visited an immense
establishment in Austria, which gives employment to several hundred
hands; I went over the whole, and conversed with the managers, who
detailed to me the same evils and the same fruits as those I have
narrated to the House&mdash;prolonged labour of sixteen, and seventeen hours,
intense fatigue, enfeebled frame, frequent consumptive disorders, and
early deaths&mdash;yet the locality had every advantage; well-built and airy
houses in a fine open country, and a rural district; nevertheless, so
injurious are the effects, that the manager added, stating at the same
time the testimony of many others who resided in districts where mills
are more abundant, that, in ten years from the time at which he spoke,
"there would hardly be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span> man in the whole of those neighbourhoods fit
to carry a musket."</p>

<p>Let me remind, too, the House of the mighty change which has taken place
among the opponents to this question. When I first brought it forward in
1833, I could scarcely number a dozen masters on my side, I now count
them by hundreds. We have had, from the West Riding of Yorkshire, a
petition signed by 300 mill-owners, praying for a limitation of labour
to ten hours in the day. Some of the best names in Lancashire openly
support me. I have letters from others who secretly wish me well, but
hesitate to proclaim their adherence; and even among the members of the
Anti-Corn-Law League, I may boast of many firm and efficient friends.
Sir, under all the aspects in which it can be viewed, this system of
things must be abrogated or restrained&mdash;it affects the internal
tranquillity of those vast provinces, and all relations between employer
and employed&mdash;it forms a perpetual grievance and ever comes uppermost
among their complaints in all times of difficulty and discontent. It
disturbs the order of nature, and the rights of the labouring men, by
ejecting the males from the workshop, and filling their places by
females, who are thus withdrawn from all their domestic duties and
exposed to insufferable toil at half the wages that would be assigned to
males, for the support of their families. It affects&mdash;nay, more, it
absolutely annihilates, all the arrangements and provisions of domestic
economy&mdash;thrift and management are altogether impossible; had they twice
the amount of their present wages, they would be but slightly
benefited&mdash;everything runs to waste; the house and children are
deserted; the wife can do nothing for her husband and family; she can
neither cook, wash, repair clothes, nor take charge of the infants; all
must be paid for out of her scanty earnings, and, after all, most
imperfectly done. Dirt, discomfort, ignorance, recklessness, are the
portion of such households; the wife has no time for learning in her
youth, and none for practice in her riper age; the females are most
unequal to the duties of the men in the factories; and all things go to
rack and ruin, because the men can discharge at home no one of the
especial duties that Providence has assigned to the females. Why need I
detain the House by a specification of these injurious results? They
will find them stated at painful length in the Second Report<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span> of the
Children's Employment Commission. Consider it, too, under its physical
aspect! Will the House turn a deaf ear to the complaints of suffering
that resound from all quarters? Will it be indifferent to the physical
consequences on the rising generation? You have the authority of the
Government Commissioner, Dr. Hawkins, a gentleman well skilled in
medical statistics&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I have never been (he tells you) in any town in Great Britain or in
Europe, in which degeneracy of form and colour from the national
standard has been so obvious as in Manchester."</p></div>

<p>I have, moreover, the authority of one of the most ardent antagonists,
himself a mighty mill-owner, that, if the present system of labour be
persevered in, the "county of Lancaster will speedily become a province
of pigmies." The toil of the females has hitherto been considered the
characteristic of savage life; but we, in the height of our refinement,
impose on the wives and daughters of England a burthen from which, at
least during pregnancy, they would be exempted even in slave-holding
states, and among the Indians of America. But every consideration sinks
to nothing compared with that which springs from the contemplation of
the moral mischiefs this system engenders and sustains. You are
poisoning the very sources of order and happiness and virtue; you are
tearing up, root and branch, all the relations of families to each
other; you are annulling, as it were, the institution of domestic life,
decreed by Providence Himself, the wisest and kindest of earthly
ordinances, the mainstay of social peace and virtue, and therein of
national security.</p>

<p class='center'><i>Right Hon. Sir J.R.G. Graham<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>:</i></p>

<p>Sir, I never rose to discharge any duty in this House which I considered
at the same time more painful and more imperative. The pain, I must
admit, is considerably increased by the eloquence of the address which
my noble friend has just concluded, and especially of the passage which
marked the close of his speech. The noble lord has asked whether any man
will be found in this House to resist the proposal which he has thought
it his duty to make, and he has appealed to considerations of justice
and mercy, intimating, if not directly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span> at least by implication, that
resistance to his motion is inconsistent both with justice and mercy. I,
on the other hand, having due regard to those sacred principles which my
noble friend has invoked, am bound, on my own part, and on the part of
the Government, to offer to the proposal of the noble Lord my decided
opposition.</p>

<p>The noble lord said, the time is come when, in his opinion, it is
necessary to lay the axe to the root of the tree. Before we do this let
me entreat the Committee carefully to consider what is that tree which
we are to lay prostrate. If it be, as I suppose, the tree of the
commercial greatness of this country, I am satisfied that although some
of its fruits may be bitter, yet upon the whole it has produced that
greatness, that wealth, that prosperity, which make these small islands
most remarkable in the history of the civilised world, which, upon the
whole, diffuse happiness amidst this great community, and render this
nation one of the most civilised, if not the most civilised, and
powerful on the face of the globe.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>My noble friend stated that he would not enter into the commercial part
of the question; but if I can show that the inevitable result of the
abridgement of time will be the diminution of wages to the employed,
then I say, with reference to the interests of the working classes
themselves, there never was a more doubtful question before Parliament
than this. The House will remember that the branches of manufacture
affected by this Bill are dependent upon machinery. Such is the rapidity
with which improvements are made, that no machinery can last more than
twelve or thirteen years without alterations; and master manufacturers
have been obliged to pull down machinery that was perfectly sound and
good to make the necessary alterations which competition forces upon
them. Well, then, it is necessary to replace machinery in the course of
twelve or thirteen years. You are now discussing whether you shall
abridge by one-sixth the period of time in which capital is to be
replaced, all interest upon it paid, and the original outlay restored.
Such an abridgement would render it impossible that capital with
interest should be restored. Then in the close race of competition which
our manufacturers are now running with foreign competitors, it must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>
considered what effect this reduction of one-sixth of the hours of
labour would have upon them. The question in its bearing upon
competition must be carefully considered; and I have been informed that
in that respect such a step would be fatal to many of our
manufacturers&mdash;a feather would turn the scale: an extra pound weight
would lose the race. But that would not be the first effect. The first
effect would fall upon the operative. It is notorious that a great part
of the power of the mill-owners, a power which alone justifies such
legislation as this, arises from the redundant supply of labour. It
follows that when a master is pressed upon by your legislation, he will
compensate himself by forcing upon those in his employ a decrease of
wages. I believe the large majority of intelligent operatives comprehend
that proposition thoroughly. I have seen many, and conversed with them,
and they have admitted that the proposal involves a necessary decrease
of wages. In the report presented in 1841 by my excellent friend Mr.
Horner, who has discharged with the most honourable fidelity the duty of
inspector of factories, there is information upon this point, and with
the permission of the House I will read a passage&mdash;a single passage
only&mdash;but one which goes to the root of the whole subject. Mr. Horner
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I have made an estimate of the loss a mill would sustain from
working eleven hours a day only instead of twelve, and I find it
would amount to &pound;850 per annum. If it were reduced to ten hours, it
would be about &pound;1,530 per annum. Unless, therefore, the mill-owner
can obtain a proportionately higher price for the commodity, he must
reduce wages or abandon his trade. I have made some calculations as
to the probable reduction of wages, and of the whole loss that would
be thrown on the operatives. I make the amount in the case of eleven
hours a day to be 13 per cent., and in the case of ten hours a day 25
per cent. at the present average rate of wages."</p></div>

<p>Now, I believe this to be perfectly accurate. The question then arises,
whether you shall create in the manufacturing districts one sudden
general fall of wages to the amount of 25 per cent? I believe that the
adoption of the motion of my noble friend would produce that effect.
Though I am most anxious to take every precaution with regard to infant
labour&mdash;though I am as firmly resolved as my noble friend to urge upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
the House to put a limit upon female labour, still, upon the whole, I
cannot recommend the House to adopt an enactment which limits the labour
of young persons to a shorter period than twelve hours.</p>

<p class='center'><i>Mr. T. Milner Gibson</i><a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>:</p>

<p>As the right hon. baronet had alluded to the argument of not destroying
the profits upon manufactures, he (Mr. Gibson) would read some remarks
upon that point by Mr. Senior, a gentleman whose name would be of great
weight with hon. members. In 1836 or 1837, Mr. Senior, with some other
gentlemen, went into the manufacturing districts with the view of
ascertaining the effect of factory legislation, and making observations
upon the factory population. Mr. Senior wrote a letter dated the 28th
March, 1837, to Mr. Poulett Thomson to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Under the present law, no mill in which persons under eighteen years
of age are employed (and, therefore, scarcely any mill at all), can
be worked more than eleven and a half hours a day, that is twelve
hours for five days in a week, and nine on Saturday. The following
analysis will show that in a mill so worked the whole net profit is
derived from the last hour. I will suppose a manufacturer of
100,000<i>l.</i>&mdash;80,000<i>l.</i> in his mill and machinery, and 20,000<i>l.</i> in
raw material and wages. The annual return of that mill, supposing the
capital to be turned once a year, and gross profits to be 15 per
cent., ought to be goods worth 115,000<i>l.</i> produced by the constant
conversion and reconversion of the 20,000<i>l.</i> circulating capital,
from money into goods and from goods into money, in periods of rather
more than two months. Of this 115,000<i>l.</i>, each of the 23 half hours
of work produces 5-115ths, or 1-23rd. Of these 23-23rds (constituting
the whole 115,000<i>l.</i>) 20, that is to say, 100,000<i>l.</i> out of the
115,000<i>l.</i>, simply replace the capital; 1-23rd (or 5,000<i>l.</i> out of
the 115,000<i>l.</i>) makes up for the deterioration of the mill and
machinery. The remaining 2-23rds, the last two of the twenty-three
half hours of every day, produce the net profit of 10 per cent. If,
therefore (prices remaining the same), the factory could be kept at
work thirteen hours instead of eleven <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>and a half, by an addition of
about 2,600<i>l.</i> to the circulating capital, the net profit would be
more than doubled. On the other hand, if the hours of working were
reduced by one hour per day (prices remaining the same), net profit
would be destroyed; if they were reduced by an hour and a half, even
gross profit would be destroyed. The circulating capital would be
replaced, but there would be no fund to compensate the progressive
deterioration of the fixed capital."</p></div>

<p>It was clear that this principle of Mr. Senior's was sound, and if hon.
gentlemen would consider it carefully they would find it indisputable.
The House would consider whether they would not, as the right hon.
baronet had expressed it, be affecting the safety and stability of the
great staple manufactures, under the impression that they were
legislating humanely for the working classes, while, in point of fact,
the result would be that by the depreciation of manufactures, the
greatest possible injury would be inflicted upon the operatives.</p>

<p><i>Mr. J. Bright</i><a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> said, It is with unfeigned reluctance that I rise
to speak, having so recently addressed the House at some length, but
being intimately connected with the branch of industry which is affected
by the proposition now under consideration, and having lived all my life
among the population most interested in this Bill, and having listened
most attentively for more than two hours to the speech of the noble
lord, the member for Dorsetshire, I think I am entitled to be heard on
the question now under discussion. I have listened to that speech
without much surprise, because I have heard or read the same speech, or
one very like it, on former occasions, and I did not suppose that any
material change had taken place in the opinions of the noble lord. It
appears to me, however, that he has taken a one-sided view, a most
unjust and unfair view of the question; it may not be intentionally, but
still a view which cannot be borne out by facts; a view, moreover, which
factory inspectors and their reports will not corroborate, and one
which, if it influence the decision of this House, will be most
prejudicial to that very class which the noble lord intends to serve.
The right hon. baronet, the Secretary for the Home Department, who is, I
presume, the promoter of this Bill, should have given the House some
reason for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span> introduction of a new Factory Bill. No such reason has
yet been given, and I am at a loss to discover any grounds on which it
can with fairness be asserted that the Bill now in operation has failed
in its effect. I know the inspectors affirm that it cannot be fully
carried out. Every body who knows anything of the manufactories of the
North, knew when it was passed that it could not be fully carried out;
and the proposition now made, is to render this impracticable Act more
stringent. In a trade so extensive, employing so many people, carried on
under circumstances ever varying, no Act of Parliament interfering with
the minute details of its management, can ever be fully carried out. I
am not one who will venture to say that the manufacturing districts of
this country are a paradise; I believe there are in those districts
evils great and serious; but whatever evils do there exist are referable
to other causes than to the existence of factories and long chimneys.
Most of the statements which the noble lord has read, would be just as
applicable to Birmingham, or to this metropolis, as to the northern
districts; and as he read them over, with respect to the ignorance and
intemperance of the people, the disobedience of children to their
parents, the sufferings of mothers, and the privations which the
children endure, I felt that there was scarcely a complaint which has
been made against the manufacturing districts of the north of England,
which might not be urged with at least as much force against the poorest
portion of the population of every large city in Great Britain and
Ireland. But among the population of Lancashire and Yorkshire, where
towns are so numerous as almost to touch each other, these evils are
more observable than in a population less densely crowded together. I
can prove, however, and I do not wish to be as one-sided as the noble
lord, I can prove from authorities, which are at least as worthy of
attention as his, the very reverse in many respects of what he has
stated as the true state of those districts. Now the Committee will bear
in mind that a large portion of the documents which the noble lord has
quoted, have neither dates nor names. I can give dates and names, and I
feel confident that the authorities I shall cite are worthy of the
deepest attention. I must go over the grounds of complaint which the
noble lord has urged, and although I may run the risk of being a little
tedious, yet considering that for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span> two hours or more I have listened to
the charges which he has made, I do think that, connected as I am most
intimately with the population and the district to which the noble lord
has alluded, I have a right to an audience for the counter-statement
which I have to make. Now, with respect to the health of the persons
employed, and I will speak more particularly of the cotton trade, with
which I am more immediately connected, Mr. Harrison, the inspecting
surgeon for Preston, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I have made very particular inquiries respecting the health of every
child whom I have examined, and I find that the average annual
sickness of each child is not more than four days; at least not more
than four days are lost by each child in a year in consequence of
sickness. This includes disorders of every kind, for the most part
induced by causes wholly unconnected with factory labour. I have been
not a little surprised to find so little sickness which can fairly be
attributed to mill work. I have met with very few children who have
suffered from injuries occasioned by machinery; and the protection,
especially in new factories, is now so complete, that accidents will,
I doubt not, speedily become rare. I have not met with a single
instance, out of 1,656 children whom I examined, of deformity that is
referable to factory labour. It must be admitted that factory
children do not present the same blooming, robust appearance, as is
witnessed among children who labour in the open air; but I question
if they are not more exempt from acute disease, and do not, on the
whole, suffer less sickness than those who are regarded as having
more healthy employments."</p></div>

<p>This was the statement of a man who had for a long time been
inspecting-surgeon in a district where there are a large number of
mills, and it may be taken as a fair criterion of the rest. In the
analysis of the Factory Report, page 16, I find the following
statement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In conclusion, then, it is proved, by a preponderance of seventy-two
witnesses against seventeen, that the health of those employed in
cotton mills is nowise inferior to that in other occupations; and,
secondly, it is proved by tables drawn up by the secretary of a sick
club, and by the more extensive tables of a London actuary, that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>the
health of the factory children is decidedly superior to that of the
labouring poor otherwise employed."</p></div>

<p>From the Factory Inspector's Reports in 1834 I have extracted the
following testimony, and no doubt this evidence is quite as good as if
it had been given this year; for from that time to this there has been a
progressive improvement in everything relating to the management of the
factories of the north of England.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The general tenor of all the medical reports in my possession
confirms Mr. Harrison's view of factory labour on the health of the
younger branches of working hands. It is decidedly not injurious to
health or longevity, compared with other employments." Then, in page
51, Mr. Saunders says, "It appears in evidence, that of all
employments to which children are subjected, those carried on in
factories are among the least laborious, and of all departments of
in-door labour, amongst the least unwholesome." Mr. Horner says, "It
is gratifying to be able to state, that I have not had a single
complaint laid before me either on the part of the masters against
their servants, or of the servants against their masters; nor have I
seen or heard of any instance of ill-treatment of children, or of
injury to their health by their employment." And on the 21st of July,
1834, speaking on the employment of children, he says: "And as their
occupation in the mills is so light as to cause no bodily fatigue,
they would pass their eight hours there as beneficially as at home;
indeed, in most cases, far more so."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I think I have now said enough with regard to this part of the
subject&mdash;apparently too much for hon. gentlemen opposite, who appear
only anxious to hear and applaud one side, and many of whom have not
even heard that. But notwithstanding all these facts I admit there are
evils, serious evils, and much distress in the manufacturing districts;
many are still out of employment, and in many branches of trade wages
are low. We have violent fluctuations in trade, and periods when
multitudes endure great suffering and it becomes this House to inquire
why do these fluctuations occur, and what is the great cause of their
suffering. I attribute much of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span> to the mistaken and unjust policy
pursued by this House, with respect to the trade and industry of the
country. Hitherto manufacturers have had no fair chance: you have
interfered with their natural progress, you have crippled them by your
restrictions, you have at times almost destroyed them by monopolies, you
have made them the sources of your public revenue, and the upholders of
your rents, but at your hands they have never to this moment received
justice and fair dealing. I do not charge the noble lord with
dishonesty, but I am confident if he had looked at this question with as
anxious a desire to discover truth, as he has to find materials for his
case, he would have found many subjects of congratulation to
counterbalance every one which he would have had reason to deplore. The
noble lord and hon. gentlemen opposite, when they view from their
distant eminence the state of the manufacturing districts, look through
the right end of the telescope; what they see is thus brought near to
them, and is greatly magnified; but when they are asked to look at the
rural districts, they reverse the telescope and then everything is
thrown to the greatest possible distance and is diminished as much as
possible.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The noble lord, the Member for Liverpool, says, he is most anxious to
improve the condition of the working classes; he points to more
education, a higher state of morals, better food and better clothing, as
the result of the adoption of the proposition now before the House. But
there is one thing that the noble lord has failed to prove; he has
failed to show how working only ten hours will give the people more
sugar. The noble lord is the representative of the sugar monopolists of
Liverpool, and, after voting to deprive the people of sugar, he is
perfectly consistent in denying them the liberty even to work. The
people ask for freedom for their industry, for the removal of the
shackles on their trade; you deny it to them, and then forbid them to
labour, as if working less would give them more food, whilst your
monopoly laws make food scarce and dear. Give them liberty to work, give
them the market of the world for their produce, give them the power to
live comfortably, and increasing means and increasing intelligence will
speedily render them independent enough and wise enough to bring the
duration of labour to that point at which life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span> shall be passed with
less of irksome toil of every kind, and more of recreation and
enjoyment. It is because I am convinced this project is now
impracticable, and that under our present oppressive legislation, it
would make all past injustice only more intolerable, that I shall vote
against the proposition which the noble lord, the member for Dorset, has
submitted to the House.</p>

<p>An Act to amend the Laws relating to Labour in Factories.</p>

<p>XX. And be it enacted, that no child or young person shall be allowed to
clean any part of the mill-gearing in a factory while the same is in
motion for the purpose of propelling any part of the manufacturing
machinery; and no child or young person shall be allowed to work between
the fixed and traversing part of any self-acting machine while the
latter is in motion by the action of the steam engine, water-wheel, or
other mechanical power.</p>

<p>XXI. And be it enacted, that every fly-wheel directly connected with the
steam engine or water-wheel or other mechanical power, whether in the
engine house or not, and every part of a steam engine and water-wheel,
and every hoist or teagle, near to which children or young persons are
liable to pass or be employed, and all parts of the mill-gearing in a
factory, shall be securely fenced; and every wheel-race not otherwise
secured shall be fenced close to the edge of the wheel-race; and the
said protection to each part shall not be removed while the parts
required to be fenced are in motion by the action of the steam engine,
water-wheel, or other mechanical power for any manufacturing process.</p>

<p>XXIV. And be it enacted, that one of Her Majesty's principal Secretaries
of State, on the report and recommendation of an inspector, may empower
such inspector to direct one or more actions to be brought in the name
and on behalf of any person who shall be reported by such inspector to
have received any bodily injury from the machinery of any factory, for
the recovery of damages for and on behalf of such person.</p>

<p>XXIX. And be it enacted, that every child who shall have completed his
eighth year, and shall have obtained the surgical certificate required
by this act of having completed his eighth year, may be employed in a
factory in the same manner and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span> under the same regulations as children
who have completed their ninth year; but no child under eight years of
age shall be employed in any factory.</p>

<p>XXX. And be it enacted, that no child shall be employed in any factory
more than six hours and thirty minutes in any one day, save as
hereinafter excepted, unless the dinner time of the young persons in
such factory shall begin at one of the clock, in which case children
beginning to work in the morning may work for seven hours in one day;
and no child who shall have been employed in a factory before noon of
any day shall be employed in the same or any other factory, either for
the purpose of recovering lost time or otherwise, after one of the clock
in the afternoon of the same day, save in the cases when children may
work on alternate days, or in silk factories more than seven hours in
any one day, as hereinafter provided.</p>

<p>XXXI. And be it enacted, that in any factory in which the labour of
young persons is restricted to ten hours in any one day it shall be
lawful to employ any child ten hours in any one day on three alternate
days of every week, provided that such child shall not be employed in
any manner in the same or in any other factory on two successive days,
nor after half past four of the clock in the afternoon of any Saturday:
Provided always, that the parent or person having direct benefit from
the wages of any child so employed shall cause such child to attend some
school for at least five hours between the hours of eight of the clock
in the morning and six of the clock in the afternoon of the same day on
each week day preceding each day of employment in the factory, unless
such preceding day shall be a Saturday, when no school attendance of
such child shall be required: Provided also, that on Monday in every
week after that in which such child began to work in the factory, or any
other day appointed for that purpose by the inspector of the District,
the occupier of the factory shall obtain a certificate from a
schoolmaster, according to the form and directions given in the schedule
(A) to this act annexed, that such child has attended school as required
by this act; but it shall not be lawful to employ any child in a factory
more than seven hours in any one day, until the owner of the factory
shall have sent a notice in writing to the inspector of the district of
his intention to restrict the hours of labour of young persons in the
factory to ten hours a day, and to employ children ten hours<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</a></span> a day; and
if such occupier of a factory shall at any time cease so to employ
children ten hours a day he shall not again employ any child in his
factory more than seven hours in any one day until he shall have sent a
further notice to the inspector in the manner hereinbefore provided.</p>

<p>XXXII. And be it enacted, that no female above the age of eighteen years
shall be employed in any factory save for the same time and in the same
manner as young persons may be employed in factories; and that any
person who shall be convicted of employing a female above the age of
eighteen years for any longer time or in any other manner shall for
every such offence be adjudged to pay the same penalty as is provided in
the like case for employing a young person contrary to law: provided
always, that nothing herein or in the Factory Act contained as to
certificates of age shall be taken to apply to females above the age of
eighteen years.</p>

<p>The history of modern Trade Unions is separated from that of earlier
combinations by the industrial changes of the eighteenth century and by
the alterations in the law affecting them. Illustrations of combinations
are given from the seventeenth century (No. 1), the early middle and
later eighteenth century (Nos. 2, 3 and 4) and the early nineteenth
century (Nos. 7 and 11). The most important changes in the law were made
towards the close of the period (Nos. 5, 6, 8, 10).</p>

<p>The strike of the Journeymen Feltmakers (No. 1) shows a well-organised
body of London craftsmen at the end of the seventeenth century fighting
the chartered Company on a wages question in a time of rising prices.
The struggle was long, and ended, in 1699, in arbitration by Members of
Parliament. The Journeymen Tailors' combination against which the Master
Tailors appealed to Parliament in 1721 (No. 2) was also a London
organisation, and claimed to control the hours of labour as well as
wages. The woolcombers (No. 4) were early famous for combined action,
and their system was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span> remarkable for the way in which it combined a
fighting trade policy with Friendly Benefit. The declaration of the
miners in the northern coalfield (No. 3) refers to one of the recurring
struggles over the yearly Bindings. The result of the strike is unknown.</p>

<p>The Master Tailors and the employers in some other trades were
successful in procuring special Acts of Parliament forbidding
combinations (No. 2, note). At the end of the eighteenth century the two
general Combination Acts made most kinds of trade union action
specifically illegal (No. 5 and No. 6). Combination still survived, but
their leaders were always open to attack in emergencies like that of the
Scotch weavers' strike (No. 7). Their special liability under the Act of
1800 was removed in 1824, and, though an outburst of strikes led to a
revision of the law, the skilled assistance of Francis Place and Hume
saved the Trade Unions from being thrust back into their former position
(Nos. 8 and 10). But organised striking could also be brought within the
common law of conspiracy. Strikers had been proceeded against in this
way before (No. 9); and this liability remained after 1825, as well as
liability under an Act against oaths of secrecy (No. 11). The case of
the Dorchester agricultural labourers (No. 11) also serves to illustrate
the great, though short-lived enthusiasm of the Trade Union movement in
the 'thirties. Its failure was followed by the rise of Chartism. The
immediate objects of the Chartists were political, but their real
grievances and ideals were economic, as their early manifestos plainly
show (No. 12); and their leaders wavered between political methods and
the direct action of the general strike (No. 13). The Rochdale Pioneers
co-operative society (No. 14) was founded in the middle of this period
of Trade Union and Chartist agitation, and illustrates a third parallel
development of working-men's combinations under the stress of the
Industrial Revolution.</p>

Assistants of this Company that he or they have served his or their

journeymen of the Mistery do give or take more than the rates above
mentioned upon pain that the party offending shall forfeit for every
time he shall be found to act contrary to the true meaning of the above
order such sum of money, not exceeding the sum of 5<i>l.</i>, as the Court of
Assistants of this Company shall think fit to impose on him or them.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 30th, 1696.</i> Geo. Burkeridge and others to the number of 12
journeymen of the Mistery to this Court on behalf of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span> themselves and all
the journeymen of the trade within the limits of the Corporation, that
they are come to a resolution among themselves not to accept of any less
wages for making of hats than what they formerly received and desire
that the late Order for lessening their wages may be set aside.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>June 20th,1698.</i> George Burkeridge, Thomas Newby and one other
journeyman came to this Court on behalf of themselves and the other
journeymen for the accommodation of the matters in difference between
them and the Company, and offered that in order thereto all matters
relating to the trade might stand on the same foot as in 1682 and suits
touching the singeing boys to be forborne. After long debate thereupon
had, the Court acquainted them, that if they would give an ingenuous
account and full discovery of their combinations and collections of
money against the Company by Wednesday next, they might expect some
favour, which the journeymen promised to comply with.</p>

<p><i>August 5th, 1698.</i> The Master reported to this Court that the committee
appointed last Court to meet several journeymen of the trade with Mr.
Cox and Mr. Cholmley in order to accommodate the matters in difference
between the masters and journeymen, who had then declared their sorrow
for their unlawful combinations to raise their wages and promised to
subscribe an Instrument declaring the same, and that they would for the
future be obedient to the bye-laws of the Company and discover all such
evil practices. And a draft of such Instrument or submission being read,
it is ordered that the same be engrossed with such alteration as the
Clerk shall think fit and be signed by the persons indicted and fifteen
more of such of the journeymen as the Master and Wardens shall direct.
And thereupon the prosecutions shall be stayed. [The Instrument.]</p>

<p>We whose hands are hereunto subscribed and set, being journeymen
Feltmakers in and about the city of London and borough of Southwark, do
hereby acknowledge:&mdash;that we with other journeymen of the said trade
have held several meetings wherein we have conspired and combined
together to enhance the prices for making of hats, for which several of
us now stand indicted, and being now greatly sensible and fully
convinced of the unlawfulness of such conspiracies do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span> hereby declare
our hearty and unfeigned sorrow for the same, and we and every one of us
do hereby promise and agree to and with the Master, Wardens and
Commonalty of the Company of Feltmakers, London, that neither we nor any
of us (nor any other journeyman of the trade with our or any of our
privity or consent) shall or will at any time hereafter do any act or
thing whatsoever that may in any wise tend to the promoting or
encouraging of such conspiracies or combinations. But that we and every
of us shall and will do all that in us lieth to discourage and prevent
such conspiracies and combinations for the future, and also will
endeavour to raise and collect money among the journeymen Feltmakers
what they shall freely contribute and pay towards prosecuting the French
or any other unlawful workers in the said Trade. And for that purpose
shall and will truly pay such money that shall be raised by such
contributions into the hands of the Master of the said Company for the
time being. And we do further promise that we will for the time to come
behave and demean ourselves tractable and conformable to the government
and bye-laws of the said Company.</p>

<p><i>July 3rd,1699.</i> The Masters reported to this Court that on Tuesday last
he attended, with others of the Company, on the Parliament Members for
the County of Surrey, according to a Rule of the Court made by the Lord
Chief Justice Holt at the last Assizes at Kingston. And after hearing
them and the defendants and other journeymen of the trade, they made an
award and therein made no other alteration of the rates than 2<i>d.</i>
allowance on a Beaver, a penny on a 14<i>s.</i> hat, and a penny allowance on
an 8<i>s.</i>, and so on to a 10<i>s.</i> hat, and they directed the indictment to
be discharged and bill in Chancery to be dismissed.</p>

Journeymen</span><a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> [<i>British Museum, f.</i> 816 <i>m.</i>, 14 (<i>II</i>)],1721.</p>

<p>"The case of the Master Tailors residing within the Cities of London and
Westminster, in relation to the great Abuses committed by their
Journeymen. Humbly offered to the consideration of Parliament.</p>

<p>The Journeymen Tailors in and about the cities of London<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span> and
Westminster, to the number of seven thousand and upwards, have lately
entered into a combination to raise their wages, and leave off working
an hour sooner than they used to do; and for the better carrying on
their design, have subscribed their respective names in books prepared
for that purpose, at the several houses of call or resort (being public
houses in and about London and Westminster) where they use; and collect
several considerable sums of money to defend any prosecutions against
them.</p>

<p>At this time there are but few of them come to work at all, and most of
those that do, insist upon, and have, twelve shillings and ninepence per
week (instead of ten shillings and ninepence per week, the usual wages),
and leave off work at eight of the clock at night (instead of nine,
their usual hour, time out of mind), and very great numbers of them go
loitering about the town, and seduce and corrupt all they can meet: to
the great hindrance and prejudice of trade.</p>

<p>Upon complaint made to some of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace, they
have issued out their warrants against these offenders as loiterers; by
virtue whereof some of them have been bound over to the Sessions, and
others have been taken up, and bound over to appear in His Majesty's
Court of King's Bench at Westminster, and the subscription books seized
by virtue of the Secretary of State's warrant: Yet they still continue
obstinate, and persist not only in putting the abovesaid difficulties
upon their masters, to the great prejudice of trade in general; but also
in collecting great sums of money to support their unlawful combinations
and confederacies.</p>

<p>This combination of the Journeymen Tailors is and may be attended with
many evil consequences: inasmuch as the public is deprived of the
benefit of the labour of a considerable number of the subjects of this
kingdom, and the families of several of these journeymen thereby
impoverished, and likely to become a charge and burden to the public:
And the very persons themselves who are under this unlawful combination,
choosing rather to live in idleness, than to work at their usual rates
and hours, will not only become useless and burdensome, but also very
dangerous to the public; and are of very ill example to journeymen in
all other trades; as is sufficiently seen in the Journeymen Curriers,
Smiths, Farriers, Sail-makers, Coach-makers, and artificers of divers
other arts and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span> misteries, who have actually entered into confederacies
of the like nature; and the Journeymen Carpenters, Bricklayers and
Joiners have taken some steps for that purpose, and only wait to see the
event of others.</p>

<p>These Journeymen Tailors, when there is a hurry of business against the
King's Birth-day, or for making of mourning or wedding garments (as
often happens) or other holidays, and always the summer seasons, are not
content with the unreasonable rates they at present insist upon; but
have demanded, and have had three or four shillings a day, and sometimes
more; otherwise they will not work; and at such times some will not work
at all; which is a great disappointment to gentlemen, and an imposition
to the masters; and, if suffered to go on, must increase the charge of
making clothes considerably.</p>

<p>As to the said houses of call, or public-houses, there are a great
number of them in London and the suburbs, where these journeymen tailors
frequently meet and use, and spend all or the greatest part of the
moneys they receive for their wages; and the masters of these houses of
call, support, encourage and abet these journeymen in their unlawful
combinations for raising their wages, and lessening their hours.</p>

<p>The laws now in being for regulating of artificers, labourers, and
servants, were made in the fifth of Queen Elizabeth, and might well be
adapted for these times; but not altogether so proper for the trade of
London and Westminster, &amp;c., as it is now carried on.</p>

<p>Therefore, the masters humbly hope this honourable house will take such
measures, by passing of a law for redress of the public grievances
aforesaid, or grant such other relief, as in their great wisdom shall
seem meet.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

[<i>Newcastle Chronicle, September 21, 1765</i>], 1765.</p>

<p>Whereas several scandalous and false reports have been and still
continue to be spread abroad in the country concerning the Pitmen in the
Counties of Durham and Northumberland absenting from their respective
employments before the expiration of their Bonds: This is therefore to
inform the Public that most of the Pitmen in the aforesaid Counties of
Durham and Northumberland were bound the latter end of August, and the
remainder of them were bound the beginning of September, 1764, and they
served till the 24th or 25th of August, 1765, which they expect is the
due time of their servitude; but the honourable Gentlemen in the Coal
Trade will not let them be free till the 11th of November, 1765, which,
instead of 11 months and 15 days, the respective time of their Bonds, is
upwards of 14 months. So they leave the most censorious to judge whether
they be right or wrong. For they are of opinion that they are free from
any Bond wherein they were bound.&mdash;And an advertisement appearing in the
newspapers last week commanding all persons not to employ any Pitmen
whatever for the support of themselves and families, it is confidently
believed that they who were the authors of the said advertisement are
designed to reduce the industrious poor of the aforesaid counties to the
greatest misery: as all the necessaries of Life are at such exorbitant
prices, that it is impossible for them to support their families without
using some other lawful means, which they will and are determined to do,
as the said advertisement has caused the people whom they were employed
under to discharge them from their service:&mdash;Likewise the said
honourable Gentlemen have agreed and signed an Article, not to employ
any Pitmen that has served in any other colliery the year before; which
will reduce them to still greater hardships, as they will be obliged to
serve in the same colliery for life; which they conjecture will take
away the ancient character of this Kingdom as being a free nation.&mdash;So
the Pitmen are not designed to work for or serve any of the said
Gentlemen, in any of their collieries, till they be fully satisfied that
the said Article is dissolved, and new Bonds and Agreements made and
entered into for the year ensuing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span></p>

subsist them till they get work.... And being asked, whether there are
any number of woolcombers who do not belong to the societies, he said,
"There are some, but not one in one hundred that does not belong to some
society."</p>

<p>Jonathan Sowton ... was asked, of what nature the clubs were. He said,
"It is a contribution upon every woolcomber (who is willing to be a
member of a club) according to the exigencies of their affairs: the one
end of it is to enable the woolcombers to travel from place to place to
seek for employment, when work is scarce where he resides; and the other
end of it is to have relief when he is sick wherever he may be; and if
he should die to be buried by the club; and it is necessary for him, to
entitle himself to be relieved by these clubs, to have a certificate
from the club to which he belongs, that he has behaved well in and to
the woolcombing trade, and that he is an honest man; but if he defrauds
anybody, he loses his claim to that certificate, and to the advantages
belonging to it."<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

other person, who shall at any time after the passing of this act enter
into any combination to obtain an advance of wages, or to lessen or
alter the hours or duration of the time of working, or to decrease the
quantity of work, or for any other purpose contrary to this act, or who
shall, by giving money, or by persuasion, solicitation, or intimidation,
or any other means, wilfully and maliciously endeavour to prevent any
unhired or unemployed journeyman or workman, or other person, in any
manufacture, trade, or business, or any other person wanting employment
in such manufacture, trade, or business, from hiring himself to any
manufacturer or tradesman, or person conducting any manufacture, trade,
or business, or who shall, for the purpose of obtaining an advance of
wages, or for any other purpose contrary to the provisions of this act,
wilfully and maliciously decoy, persuade, solicit, intimidate,
influence, or prevail, or attempt or endeavour to prevail, on any
journeyman or workman, or other person hired or employed, or to be hired
or employed in any such manufacture, trade, or business, to quit or
leave his work, service, or employment, or who shall wilfully and
maliciously hinder or prevent any manufacturer or tradesman, or other
person, from employing in his or her manufacture, trade, or business,
such journeymen, workmen, and other persons as he or she shall think
proper, or who, being hired or employed, shall, without any just or
reasonable cause, refuse to work with any other journeyman or workman
employed or hired to work therein, and who shall be lawfully convicted
of any of the said offences, shall, by order of such justices, be
committed to and be confined in the common gaol, within his or their
jurisdiction, for any time not exceeding three calendar months; or
otherwise be committed to some house of correction within the same
jurisdiction, there to remain and to be kept to hard labour for any time
not exceeding two calendar months.</p>

<p>IV. And for the more effectual suppression of all combinations amongst
journeymen, workmen, and other persons employed in any manufacture,
trade or business, be it further enacted, that all and every persons and
person whomsoever, (whether employed in any such manufacture, trade, or
business, or not), who shall attend any meeting had or held for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span>
purpose of making or entering into any contract, covenant, or agreement,
by this act declared to be illegal, or of entering into, supporting,
maintaining, continuing, or carrying on any combination for any purpose
by this act declared to be illegal, or who shall summons, give notice
to, call upon, persuade, entice, solicit, or by intimidation, or any
other means, endeavour to induce any journeyman, workman, or other
person employed in any manufacture, trade, or business, to attend any
such meeting, or who shall collect, demand, ask, or receive any sum of
money from any such journeyman, workman, or other person, for any of the
purposes aforesaid, or who shall persuade, entice, solicit, or by
intimidation, or any other means, endeavour to induce any such
journeyman, workman, or other person to enter into or be concerned in
any such combination, or who shall pay any sum of money, or make or
enter into any subscription or contribution, for or towards the support
or encouragement of any such illegal meeting or combination, and who
shall be lawfully convicted of any of the said offences, within three
calendar months next after the offence shall have been committed, shall,
by order of such justices, be committed to and confined in the common
gaol within his or their jurisdiction, for any time not exceeding three
calendar months, or otherwise be committed to some house of correction
within the same jurisdiction, there to remain and be kept to hard labour
for any time not exceeding two calendar months.</p>

<p>VI. And be it further enacted, that all sums of money which at any time
heretofore have been paid or given as a subscription or contribution for
or towards any of the purposes prohibited by this act, and shall, for
the space of three calendar months next after the passing of this act,
remain undivided in the hands of any treasurer, collector, receiver,
trustee, agent, or other person, or placed out at interest, and all sums
of money which shall at any time after the passing of this act, be paid
or given as a subscription or contribution for or towards any of the
purposes prohibited by this act, shall be forfeited, one moiety thereof
to his Majesty, and the other moiety to such person as will sue for the
same in any of his Majesty's courts of record at Westminster; and any
treasurer, collector, receiver, trustee, agent, or other person in whose
hands or in whose name any such sum of money shall be, or shall be
placed out, or unto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span> whom the same shall have been paid or given, shall
and may be sued for the same as forfeited as aforesaid.</p>

<p>[All contracts between masters or other persons for reducing the wages
of workmen or for altering the hours of work or for increasing the
quantity of work, are to be void. Masters convicted of such agreements,
shall be fined 20<i>l.</i>: half to go to the Crown, half to the informer and
the poor of the parish.]</p>

<p>XVIII. And whereas it will be a great convenience and advantage to
masters and workmen engaged in manufactures, that a cheap and summary
mode be established for settling all disputes that may arise between
them respecting wages and work; be it further enacted by the authority
aforesaid, that, from and after the first day of August in the year of
our Lord one thousand eight hundred, in all cases that shall or may
arise within that part of Great Britain called England, where the
masters and workmen cannot agree respecting the price or prices to be
paid for work actually done in any manufacture, or any injury or damage
done or alleged to have been done by the workmen to the work, or
respecting any delay or supposed delay on the part of the workmen in
finishing the work, or the not finishing such work in a good and
workmanlike manner, or according to any contract; and in all cases of
dispute or difference, touching any contract or agreement for work or
wages between masters and workmen in any trade or manufacture, which
cannot be otherwise mutually adjusted and settled by and between them,
it shall and may be, and it is hereby declared to be lawful for such
masters and workmen between whom such dispute or difference shall arise
as aforesaid, or either of them, to demand and have an arbitration or
reference of such matter or matters in dispute; and each of them is
hereby authorized and empowered forthwith to nominate and appoint an
arbitrator for and on his respective part and behalf, to arbitrate and
determine such matter or matters in dispute as aforesaid by writing,
subscribed by him in the presence of and attested by one witness, in the
form expressed in the second schedule to this Act; and to deliver the
same personally to the other party, or to leave the same for him at his
usual place of abode, and to require the other party to name an
arbitrator in like manner within two days after such reference to
arbitrators shall have been so demanded; and such arbitrators so
appointed as aforesaid, after they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span> shall have accepted and taken upon
them the business of the said arbitration, are hereby authorised and
required to summon before them, and examine upon oath the parties and
their witnesses, (which oath the said arbitrators are hereby authorised
and required to administer according to the form set forth in the second
schedule to this act), and forthwith to proceed to hear and determine
the complaints of the parties, and the matter or matters in dispute
between them; and the award to be made by such arbitrators within the
time being after limited, shall in all cases be final and conclusive
between the parties; but in case such arbitrators so appointed shall not
agree to decide such matter or matters in dispute, so to be referred to
them as aforesaid, and shall not make and sign their award within the
space of three days after the signing of the submission to their award
by both parties, that then it shall be lawful for the parties or either
of them to require such arbitrators forthwith and without delay to go
before and attend upon one of his Majesty's justices of the peace acting
in and for the county, riding, city, liberty, division, or place where
such dispute shall happen and be referred, and state to such justice the
points in difference between them the said arbitrators, which points in
difference the said justice shall and is hereby authorised and required
to hear and determine and for that purpose to examine the parties and
their witnesses upon oath, if he shall think fit.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

Artizans and Machinery</i>, 1824 (<i>V</i>), <i>pp.</i> 60-63], 1812.</p>

<p>Evidence of Mr. Alex. Richmond. 23 February, 1824.</p>

<p>Were you one of the delegates appointed by the workmen in Glasgow?</p>

<p>Yes; on the failure of the last application to Parliament the
association turned its attention to some Acts of Parliament that were
discovered, empowering the justices of the peace to affix rates of
wages, with a view to raising the wages; the fact was, fluctuation was a
greater evil perhaps, than the lowness of the rate; previous to that
period, fluctuations, to the extent of thirty per cent., took place in
the course of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span> month, in the price of labour; an attempt was made to
get an extra-judicial arrangement with the masters; the masters were
divided in opinion upon the point, some of them were for a regulation,
others opposed it; after several ineffectual attempts to come to an
arrangement with that part of the masters who opposed it, part of the
masters being in the interest of the operatives, at last a process was
entered before the quarter sessions.</p>

<p>Will you state how the process proceeded?</p>

<p>The justices of the peace found the rate demanded reasonable; it was
amended in some instances, and the masters immediately refused to pay
the rate. Our counsel in the process had consented, for the purpose of
obviating the difficulties and getting over the objections that might be
made against the expediency, to withdraw the imperative part of the
prayer; the prayer of the petition originally founded upon, prayed, that
they might be compelled to pay the price, but it was only a declaratory
decision, as the imperative part was withdrawn, for the purpose of
preventing the difficulty; we then, as the masters refused to pay, tried
every method of getting an extra-judicial decision. The present Lord
Justice Clerk had been a member of the Committee of the House of Commons
in 1809, and appeared decidedly opposed to the principle of
interference; and we conceived from the sentiments of the court, that
though they had decided the law, if we went on the expediency of the
case, we might very likely lose, and we determined therefore to try the
experiment of striking work.</p>

<p>What was the result of this strike?</p>

<p>About three weeks after the effort commenced, there was a direct
interference, on the part of government, to suppress it, by the
apprehension of all the parties concerned.</p>

<p>What do you mean by the apprehension of all the parties concerned?</p>

<p>There was a committee of five, who had conducted the process during the
whole period, and we were all apprehended and committed to gaol.</p>

<p>You were one of the five?</p>

<p>I was.</p>

<p>Under what law were you apprehended?</p>

<p>There was no specific law. There was a case I might have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span> mentioned, but
as it applies to the combination, I will introduce it here. In 1811, a
combination had taken place amongst the cotton spinners; and in a case
that was aggravated by assault, that was tried at the Glasgow circuit,
the present Lord President Hope, who then presided, stated it as an
aggravation of the crime of combination, that there was a clear remedy
in law, as the magistrates had full power and authority to affix rates
of wages, or settle disputes: that was the ground on which we entered
the action in 1812. In the face of this, after having acted upon it on
this principle, the mere act of striking work in a body was construed as
an infringement of the Combination Law; and after having acted upon the
authority of Lord President Hope, we were convicted, on what law I am
yet at a loss to know.</p>

<p>Have there been any combinations, or any individuals prosecuted for
combinations, since that period?</p>

<p>The only other branch of the cotton trade that ever had an association
or combination efficient in Scotland, was the calico printers, and they
were the next that were followed by the suppression of the cotton
weavers' branch in 1815.</p>

<p>In what manner were they broken up?</p>

<p>By the interference of government; immediately after this case, the Lord
Advocate proceeded against them, as public prosecutor in Scotland.</p>

<p>Were they paid higher than other mechanics?</p>

<p>Yes: their wages frequently averaged from forty to fifty shillings a
week, previous to that; now they are down from twelve to fifteen
shillings.</p>

[<i>The Times, June 4, 1824</i>], 1810.</p>

<p class='center'><i>To the Editor of the Times.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>That the Committee have proceeded, I will not say rashly, but, upon
misinformation, will be evident from a slight attention to the evidence
of Mr. Richard Taylor, printer.</p>

<p>In reply to some introductory questions, he states that he has been a
printer some 20 years&mdash;that he has turned his attention to the
combination laws&mdash;and that his opinion is, that they are of no service.
He afterwards states as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"There were some men imprisoned for combining a great many years ago,
and that created a great deal of misunderstanding; for they were some of
the most respectable of the workmen&mdash;those who had been intrusted by
their fellow-workmen at large to negotiate an advance of prices with the
masters; and of course the inflicting of imprisonment on men who are
generally respected was a thing which created a great deal of ill-blood:
a deal of mischief was the consequence of it."</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Taylor, then, here states that a great deal of mischief was
effected by that prosecution. But what will the Committee say, if, when
that evidence is put right, it shall be found to reflect not upon the
Combination Laws now attempted to be repealed, but upon the old common
law, which it is intended to leave in force? Mr. Taylor makes a slight
mistake as to the fact; which mistake being corrected, the whole tide of
his argument is turned away from the Combination Laws, and made to bear
upon the common law for conspiracy....</p>

<p>... How Mr. Taylor, knowing that some of the offenders in that case were
sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and knowing, at the same time,
that the Combination Laws do not admit of an imprisonment for more than
three months, should yet say that those men were tried upon the
Combination Laws, is most inconceivable.</p>

<p>James Lovelace, George Lovelace, Thomas Stanfield, John Stanfield, James

unlawful oath and engagement, purporting to bind the person taking the
same not to inform or give evidence against any associate, and not to

<p>John Lock.&mdash;I live at Half Puddle. I went to Toll Puddle a fortnight
before Christmas. I know the prisoner James Brine. I saw him that
evening at John Woolley's. He called me out and I went with him. He took
me to Thomas Stanfield's, and asked me if I would go in with him. I
refused and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span> went away. I saw him in about a fortnight afterwards in a
barn. He asked me if I would go to Toll Puddle with him. I agreed to do
so. James Hammet was then with him. Edward Legg, Richard Peary, Henry
Courtney, and Elias Riggs were with us. They joined us as we were going
along. One of them asked if there would not be something to pay, and one
said there would be 1<i>s.</i> to pay on entering, and 1<i>d.</i> a week after. We
all went into Thomas Stanfield's house into a room upstairs. John
Stanfield came to the door of the room. I saw James Lovelace and George
Lovelace go along the passage. One of the men asked if we were ready. We
said, yes. One of them said, "Then bind your eyes," and we took out
handkerchiefs and bound over our eyes. They then led us into another
room on the same floor. Someone then read a paper, but I don't know what
the meaning of it was. After that we were asked to kneel down, which we
did. Then there was some more reading; I don't know what it was about.
It seemed to be out of some part of the Bible. Then we got up and took
off the bandages from our eyes. I had then seen James Lovelace and John
Stanfield in the room. Some one read again, but I don't know what it
was, and then we were told to kiss the book, when our eyes were
unblinded, and I saw the book, which looked like a little Bible. I then
saw all the prisoners there. James Lovelace had on a white dress, it was
not a smock-frock. They told us the rules, that we should have to pay
1<i>s.</i> then, and a 1<i>d.</i> a week afterwards, to support the men when they
were standing out from their work. They said we were as brothers; that
when we were to stop for wages we should not tell our masters ourselves,
but that the masters would have a note or a letter sent to them.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mrs. Francis Wetham.&mdash;I am the wife of a painter in the town. In
October, last year, James Lovelace and another person came to our shop;
he said he wanted something painted from a design he had brought; he had
two papers with him, on one was a representation of a skull, and on the
other a skeleton arm extended with a scythe; he said it was to be
painted on canvas, a complete skeleton on a dark ground, six feet high;
over the head, "Remember thine end." I asked him what it was for,
whether a flag or a sign; he told me it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</a></span> was a secret for a society, and
he would tell me no more; if I wanted further information I was to send
to him, "J. Lovelace, Toll Puddle."</p>

<p>
Brother,
</p>

<p>We met this evening for the purpose of forming our committee. There was
16 present, of whom 10 was chosen&mdash;namely, a president, vice-president,
secretary, treasurer, warden, conductor, three outside guardians and one
inside guardian. All seemed united in heart, and expressed his approval
of the meeting. Father and Hallett wished very much to join us, but wish

and I would send for you to come at that time, if possible, and enter
them, that they may be gone before the company come. I received a note
this morning which gave me great encouragement, and I am led to
acknowledge the force of union.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25em;">(Signed by the secretary.)</p>

<p>The following rules were then put in and read:&mdash;</p>


<p class='center'><i>General Rules.</i></p>

<p>1. That this Society be called the Friendly Society of Agricultural
Labourers.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>20. That if any master attempts to reduce the wages of his workmen, if
they are members of this order, they shall instantly communicate the
same to the corresponding secretary, in order that they may receive the
support of the grand lodge; and in the meantime they shall use their
utmost endeavours to finish the work they may have in hand, if any, and
shall assist each other, so that they may all leave the place together,
and with as much promptitude as possible.</p>

<p>21. That if any member of this society ... solely on account of his
taking an active part in the affairs of this order ... shall be
discharged from his employment ... then the whole body of men at that
place shall instantly leave that place, and no member of this society
shall be allowed to take work at such place until such member be
reinstated in his situation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span></p>

<p>[22. If a member divulge any secret of the society, members throughout
the country shall refuse to work with him.]</p>

<p>23. That the object of this society can never be promoted by any act or
acts of violence, but, on the contrary, all such proceedings must tend
to injure the cause and destroy the society itself. This order therefore
will not countenance any violation of the laws.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

Victoria</span> [<i>The Life and Struggles of William Lovett</i>, <i>pp.</i> 124-8],
1837.</p>

<p>Madam,</p>

<p>While we approach your Majesty in the spirit of plain men seeking their
political and social rights, apart from mere names, forms, or useless
ceremonies, we yield to none in the just fulfilment of our duties, or in
the ardent wish that our country may be made to advance to the highest
point of prosperity and happiness....</p>

<p>The country over which your Majesty has been called on to preside, has
by the powers and industry of its inhabitants been made to teem with
abundance, and were all its resources wisely developed and justly
distributed, would impart ample means of happiness to all its
inhabitants.</p>

<p>But, by many monstrous anomalies springing out of the constitution of
society, the corruptions of government, and the defective education of
mankind, we find the bulk of the nation toiling slaves from birth till
death&mdash;thousands wanting food, or subsisting on the scantiest pittance,
having neither time nor means to obtain instruction, much less of
cultivating the higher faculties and brightest affections, but forced by
their situation to engender enmity, jealousy, and contention, and too
often to become the victims of intemperance and crime.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The exclusive few have ever been intent in keeping the people ignorant
and deluded, and have sedulously administered to their vices and
fomented their prejudices. Hence the use of their privileges and
distinctions to allure the wealthy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</a></span> corrupt the innocent; hence
their desire to retain within their own circle all the powers of the
Legislative and Executive, all the riches of Church and State....</p>

<p>To this baneful source of exclusive political power may be traced the
persecutions of fanaticism, the feuds of superstition, and most of the
wars and carnage which disgrace our history. To this pernicious origin
may justly be attributed the unremitted toil and wretchedness of your
Majesty's industrious people, together with most of the vices and crimes
springing from poverty and ignorance, which, in a country blessed by
nature, enriched by art, and boasting of her progress and knowledge,
mock her humanity and degrade her character.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We entreat your Majesty that, whoever may be in your ministry, you will
instruct them, as a first and essential measure of reform, to prepare a
bill for extending the Right of Suffrage to all the adult population of
the kingdom; excepting such as may be justly incapacitated by crime or
defection of the light of reason; together with such other essential
details as shall enable all men to exercise their political rights
unmolested.</p>

assembled:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Whether they will be prepared, at the request of the Convention, to
withdraw all sums of money they may individually or collectively have
placed in savings banks, private banks, or in the hands of any person
hostile to their just rights?</p>

<p>2. Whether, at the same request, they will be prepared immediately to
convert all their paper money into gold and silver?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Whether, if the Convention shall determine that a sacred month will
be necessary to prepare the millions to secure the charter of their
political salvation, they will firmly resolve to abstain from their
labours during that period, as well as from the use of all intoxicating
drinks?</p>

<p>4. Whether, according to their old constitutional right&mdash;a right which
modern legislators would fain annihilate&mdash;they have prepared themselves
with the arms of freemen to defend the laws and constitutional
privileges their ancestors bequeathed to them?</p>

<p>The objects of this Society are to form arrangements for the pecuniary
benefit and improvement of the social and domestic condition of its
members, by raising a sufficient amount of capital, in shares of one
pound each, to bring into operation the following plans and
arrangements:&mdash;</p>

<p>The establishment of a Store for the sale of provisions, clothing, etc.</p>

<p>The building, purchasing, or erecting a number of houses, in which those
members desiring to assist each other in improving their domestic and
social condition may reside. To commence the manufacture of such
articles as the Society may determine upon, for the employment of such
members as may be without employment, or who may be suffering in
consequence of repeated reductions in their wages.</p>

<p>As a further benefit and security to the members of this Society, the
Society shall purchase or rent an estate or estates of land, which shall
be cultivated by the members who may be out of employment or whose
labour may be badly remunerated.</p>

<p>That, as soon as practicable, this Society shall proceed to arrange the
powers of production, distribution, education and government: or, in
other words, to establish a self-supporting home colony of united
interests, or assist other societies in establishing such colonies.</p>

<p>That, for the promotion of sobriety, a Temperance Hotel be opened in one
of the Society's houses as soon as convenient.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</a></span></p>

<p>The national organisation of poor-relief was permanently affected by the
constitutional troubles of the seventeenth century. Supervision and
pressure from a central authority were removed and were not again
strongly felt till near the close of this period. This change shows
itself in the documentary evidence; national regulation is rare and
comes only as the result of a special emergency or panic (Nos. 1, 3, 4,
10). The Settlement Act of 1662 (No. 1), with its successors, was an
attempt to meet the special local difficulties which sprang from the
want of central control and uniformity. The Act of 1722 provided the
machinery for the more drastic treatment of the poor advocated in
Defoe's pamphlet (No. 2), by means of a workhouse and a system of tests
for relief; for this purpose unions of parishes could be formed (No. 3).
Gilbert's Act (No. 4) in the last quarter of the century was a reversion
to milder policy; it was intended to distinguish more clearly the
different classes of poor relieved, to provide suitable treatment for
the old infirm and children in institutions, and to find employment for
the able-bodied. It illustrates the growing pressure of industrial
changes on the working classes, as well as the current of humanitarian
feeling which ran a broken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span> course from this time to the end of the
period. It was an adoptive, not a compulsory, Act, and no more
legislative changes of the first importance were made till 1834.
Meanwhile vast transformations were being made in town and, especially,
in country life, and the destitution line was crossed by a whole section
of the nation. The Settlement laws were relaxed, but, after Pitt's
abortive proposals in 1795, Parliament stood aside. The initiative was
thus left to the local authority. The so-called Speenhamland Act of
Parliament (No. 5) is the classic instance of the methods of
supplementary allowances adopted by the Justices in various counties.
Its aim was humane; its effect, to check the pressure for higher wages,
was not intended (see No. 5, note).</p>

<p>The eighteenth century system produced great local variety, some
examples of which are given from the survey published by Eden in 1797
(Nos. 6 and 7). The official workhouse, the farming of the poor to a
contractor, the employment of the poor within the workhouse, and the
relief of the rates by the Roundsman system of servile labour are
described (Nos. 6 and 7. See also No. 8).</p>

<p>The Poor Law Commission of 1834 (No. 9) was the culminating point of a
reaction against the results of the previous half century. Its intention
was to make a clean sweep of tradition and to reassert the principle of
uniformity. Its authors, in the spirit of their age, hoped to make their
reform negatively, by cutting away influences which corrupted human
nature. The extracts (No. 9) show their leading principles and
recommendations. The Act of 1834 (No. 10) embodied their conclusions,
leaving a large discretion to a new central authority. The Regulations
and Orders (No. 11) of these Commissioners and their successors, the
Poor Law and Local Government Boards, were, henceforward, the chief
directing force of Poor Relief policy.</p>

<p>An Act for the better relief of the poor of this kingdom.</p>

<p>Whereas the necessity, number and continual increase of the poor, not
only within the Cities of London and Westminster with the liberties of
each of them, but also through the whole kingdom of England and Dominion
of Wales, is very great and exceeding burdensome, being occasioned by
reason of some defects in the law concerning the settling of the poor
and for want of a due provision of the regulations of relief and
employment in such parishes or places where they are legally settled,
which doth enforce many to turn incorrigible rogues and others to perish
for want, together with the neglect of the faithful execution of such
laws and statutes as have formerly been made for the apprehending of
rogues and vagabonds and for the good of the poor. For remedy whereof
and for the preventing the perishing of any of the poor, whether old or
young, for want of such supplies as are necessary, may it please your
most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[Pg 648]</a></span> Excellent Majesty that it may be enacted ... that whereas by
reason of some defects in the law poor people are not restrained from
going from one parish to another and therefore do endeavour to settle
themselves in those parishes where there is the best stock, the largest
commons or wastes to build cottages, and the most woods for them to burn
and destroy and when they have consumed it then to another parish, and
at last become rogues and vagabonds to the great discouragement of
parishes to provide stocks where it is liable to be devoured by
strangers ... it shall and may be lawful upon complaint made by the
churchwardens or overseers of the poor of any parish to any Justice of
Peace, within forty days after any such person or persons coming so to
settle, as aforesaid in any tenement under the yearly value of ten
pounds for any two justices of the peace whereof one to be of the Quorum
of the division where any person or persons that are likely to be
chargeable to the parish shall come to inhabit, by their warrant to
remove and convey such person or persons to such parish where he or they
were last legally settled either as a native householder sojourner
apprentice or servant for the space of forty days at the least unless he
or they give sufficient security for the discharge of the said parish to
be allowed by the said Justices.</p>

<p>[II. Appeal to Quarter Sessions.</p>

rogues and vagrants to work in the workhouse with the consent of the

Defoe, Giving Alms no Charity, etc.</i>], 1704.</p>

<p>I humbly crave leave to lay these heads down as fundamental maxims,
which I am ready at any time to defend and make out.</p>

<p>1. There is in England more labour than hands to perform it, and
consequently a want of people, not of employment.</p>

<p>2. No man in England, of sound limbs and senses, can be poor merely for
want of work.</p>

<p>3. All our workhouses, corporations and charities for employing the
poor, and setting them to work, as now they are employed, or any Acts of
Parliament, to empower overseers of parishes, or parishes themselves, to
employ the poor, except as shall be hereafter excepted, are, and will be
public nuisances, mischiefs to the nation which serve to the ruin of
families and the increase of the poor.</p>

<p>4. That it is a regulation of the poor that is wanted in England, not a
setting them to work.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The poverty and exigence of the poor in England is plainly derived from
one of these two particular causes,</p>


<p class='center'><i>Casualty or Crime.</i></p>

<p>By Casualty, I mean sickness of families, loss of limbs or sight, and
any, either natural or accidental, impotence as to labour.</p>

<p>The crimes of our people, and from whence their poverty derives, as the
visible and direct fountains are:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
1. Luxury.<br />
2. Sloth.<br />
3. Pride.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</a></span></p>

<p>This is so apparent in every place, that I think it needs no
explication; that English labouring people eat and drink, but especially
the latter, three times as much in value as any sort of foreigners of
the same dimensions in the world.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There is a general taint of slothfulness upon our poor, there is nothing
more frequent, than for an Englishman to work till he has got his pocket
full of money, and then go and be idle, or perhaps drunk, till it is all
gone, and perhaps he himself in debt; and ask him in his cups what he
intends, he will tell you honestly, he will drink as long as it lasts,
and then go to work for more.</p>

<p>IV. And for the greater ease of parishes in the relief of the poor, be
it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall and may be
lawful for the churchwardens and overseers of the poor in any parish,
town, township or place, with the consent of the major part of the
parishioners or inhabitants of the same parish, town, township or place,
in vestry, or other parish or public meeting for that purpose assembled,
or of so many of them as shall be so assembled, upon usual notice
thereof first given, to purchase or hire any house or houses in the same
parish, township or place, and to contract with any person or persons
for the lodging, keeping, maintaining and employing any or all such poor
in their respective parishes, townships or places, as shall desire to
receive relief or collection from the same parish, and there to keep,
maintain and employ all such poor persons, and take the benefit of the
work, labour and service of any such poor person or persons, who shall
be kept or maintained in any such house or houses, for the better
maintenance and relief of such poor person or persons, who shall be
there kept or maintained; and in case any poor person or persons of any
parish, town, township or place, where such house or houses shall be so
purchased or hired, shall refuse to be lodged, kept or maintained in
such house or houses, such poor person or persons so refusing shall be
put out of the book or books where the names of the persons who ought
to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</a></span> receive collection in the said parish, town, township or place, are
to be registered, and shall not be entitled to ask or receive collection
or relief from the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of the same
parish, town or township; and where any parish, town or township shall
be too small to purchase or hire such house or houses for the poor of
their own parish only, it shall and may be lawful for two or more such
parishes, towns or townships or places, with the consent of the major
part of the parishioners or inhabitants, and with the approbation of any
justice of peace dwelling in or near any such parish, town or place,
signified under his hand and seal, to unite in purchasing, hiring, or
taking such house, for the lodging, keeping and maintaining of the poor
of the several parishes, townships or places so uniting, and there to
keep, maintain and employ the poor of the parishes so uniting, and to
take and have the benefit of the work, labour or service of any poor
there kept and maintained, for the better maintenance and relief of the
poor there kept, maintained and employed; and that if any poor person or
persons in the respective parishes, townships or places so uniting,
shall refuse to be lodged, kept and maintained in the house, hired or
taken for such uniting parishes, townships or places, he, she or they so
refusing, shall be put out of the collection-book, where his, her or
their names were registered, and shall not be entitled to ask or demand
relief or collection from the churchwardens and overseers of the poor in
their respective parishes, townships or places; and that it shall and
may be lawful for the churchwardens and overseers of the poor, with the
consent of the major part of the parishioners or inhabitants, to
contract with the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of any other
parish, township or place, for the lodging, maintaining or employing, of
any poor person or persons of such other parish, township or place, as
to them shall seem meet; and in case any poor person or persons of such
other parish, township or place, shall refuse to be lodged, maintained
and employed in such house or houses, he, she or they so refusing, shall
be put out of the collection-book of such other parish, township or
place, where his, her or their names were registered, and shall not be
entitled to ask, demand or receive any relief or collection from the
churchwardens and overseers of the poor of his, her or their respective
parish, township or place: provided always, that no poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[Pg 652]</a></span> person or
persons, his, her or their apprentice, child or children, shall acquire
a settlement in the parish, town or place, to which he, she or they are
removed by virtue of this act. No person or persons shall be deemed,
adjudged or taken, to acquire or gain any settlement in any parish or
place, for or by virtue of any purchase of any estate or interest in
such parish or place, whereof the consideration for such purchase doth
not amount to the sum of thirty pounds, <i>bona fide</i> paid, for any longer
or further time than such person or persons shall inhabit in such
estate, and shall then be liable to be removed to such parish or place,
where such person or persons were last legally settled, before the said
purchase and inhabitancy therein.</p>

<p>VI. No person or persons whatsoever, who shall be taxed, rated or
assessed to the scavenger or repairs of the highway, and shall duly pay
the same, shall be deemed or taken to have any legal settlement in any
city, parish, town or hamlet, for or by reason of his, her or their
paying to such scavenger's rate or repairs of the highway as aforesaid;
any law to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.</p>

<p>An act for the better relief and employment of the poor.</p>

<p>Whereas notwithstanding the many laws now in being for the relief and
employment of the poor, and the great sums of money raised for those
purposes, their sufferings and distresses are nevertheless very
grievous; and, by the incapacity, negligence, or misconduct of
overseers, the money raised for the relief of the poor is frequently
misapplied, and sometimes expended in defraying the charges of
litigations about settlements indiscreetly and unadvisedly carried
on....</p>

<p>VII. And be it further enacted, that it shall and may be lawful for two
justices of the peace of the limit where such poor house shall be, or be
so agreed to be situated, and they are hereby required, as soon as
conveniently may be after such agreement shall have been made as
aforesaid, upon application to them by two or more of the persons who
shall have signed such agreement, and upon producing the same to them,
to appoint one of the persons so recommended to be guardian of the poor
for each of such parishes, townships, and places, in the form contained
in the said schedule, No. VII, or to that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[Pg 653]</a></span> or the like effect; and every
such guardian shall attend the monthly meetings hereby directed to be
holden, and execute the several powers and authorities given to
guardians by this act, and shall have, and is hereby invested with, all
the powers and authorities given to overseers of the poor by any other
act or acts of parliament.</p>

<p>XVII. The guardians of the poor of the several parishes, townships and
places which shall adopt the provisions of this act, shall provide a
suitable and convenient house or houses, with proper buildings and
accommodations thereto, when wanted.</p>

<p>And, to render the provisions of this act more practicable and
beneficial, be it further enacted, that no person shall be sent to such
poor house or houses, except such as are become indigent by old age,
sickness, or infirmities, and are unable to acquire a maintenance by
their labour; and except such orphan children as shall be sent thither
by order of the guardian or guardians of the poor, with the approbation
of the visitor; and except such children as shall necessarily go with
their mothers thither for sustenance.</p>

<p>XXX. And, be it further enacted, that all infant children of tender
years, and who, from accident or misfortune, shall become chargeable to
the parish or place to which they belong, may either be sent to such
poor house as aforesaid, or be placed by the guardian or guardians of
the poor, with the approbation of the visitor, with some reputable
person or persons in or near the parish, township, or place, to which
they belong, at such weekly allowance as shall be agreed upon between
the parish officers and such person or persons with the approbation of
the visitor, until such child or children shall be of sufficient age to
be put into service, or bound apprentice to husbandry, or some trade or
occupation; and a list of the names of every child so placed out, and by
whom and where kept, shall be given to the visitor; who shall see that
they are properly treated, or cause them to be removed, and placed under
the care of some other person or persons, if he finds just cause so to
do; and when every such child shall attain such age, he or she shall be
so placed out, at the expense of the parish, township, or place, to
which he or she shall belong, according to the laws in being: provided
nevertheless, that if the parents or relations of any poor child sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[Pg 654]</a></span>
to such house, or so placed out as aforesaid, or any other responsible
person, shall desire to receive and provide for any such poor child or
children, and signify the same to the guardians at their monthly
meeting, the guardians shall, and are hereby required to dismiss, or
cause to be dismissed, such child or children from the poor-house, or
from the care of such person or persons as aforesaid, and deliver him,
her, or them, to the parent, relation, or other person so applying as
aforesaid: provided also, that nothing herein contained shall give any
power to separate any child or children, under the age of seven years,
from his, her, or their parent or parents, without the consent of such
parent or parents.</p>

<p>XXXI. And be it further enacted, that all idle or disorderly persons who
are able, but unwilling, to work or maintain themselves and their
families, shall be prosecuted by the guardians of the poor of the
several parishes, townships, and places, wherein they reside, and
punished in such manner as idle and disorderly persons are directed to
be by the statute made in the seventeenth year of the reign of his late
majesty King George the Second; and if any guardian shall neglect to
make complaint thereof, against every such person or persons, to some
neighbouring justice of the peace, within ten days after it shall come
to his knowledge, he shall, for every such neglect, forfeit a sum not
exceeding five pounds, nor less than twenty shillings, one moiety
whereof, when recovered, shall be paid to the informer, and the other
moiety to be disposed of as the other forfeitures are hereinafter
directed to be applied.</p>

<p>XXXII. And be it further enacted, that where there shall be, in any
parish, township, or place, any poor person or persons who shall be able
and willing to work, but who cannot get employment, it shall and may be
lawful for the guardian of the poor of such parish, township or place,
and he is hereby required, on application made to him by or on behalf of
such poor person, to agree for the labour of such poor person or
persons, at any work or employment suited to his or her strength and
capacity, in any parish, township or place, near the place of his or her
residence, and to maintain, or cause such person or persons to be
properly maintained, lodged, and provided for, until such employment
shall be procured, and during the time of such work, and to receive the
money<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</a></span> to be earned by such work or labour, and apply it in such
maintenance, as far as the same will go, and make up the deficiency, if
any; and if the same shall happen to exceed the money expended in such
maintenance, to account for the surplus, which shall afterwards, within
one calendar month, be given to such poor person or persons who shall
have earned such money, if no further expenses shall be then incurred on
his or her account to exhaust the same. And in case such poor person or
persons shall refuse to work, or run away from such work or employment,
complaint shall be made thereof by the guardian to some justice or
justices of the peace in or near the said parish, township, or place;
who shall enquire into the same upon oath, and on conviction punish such
offender or offenders, by committing him, her, or them, to the house of
correction, there to be kept to hard labour for any time not exceeding
three calendar months, nor less than one calendar month.</p>

<p>XLI. And whereas it frequently happens that poor children, pregnant
women, or poor persons afflicted with sickness, or some bodily
infirmity, are enticed, taken, or conveyed by parish officers, or other
persons, from one parish or place to another, without any legal order of
removal, in order to ease the one parish or place, and to burden the
other with such poor person: for remedy thereof, be it further enacted,
that, when any guardian, or other person or persons, shall so entice,
take, convey, or remove, or cause or procure to be so enticed, taken,
conveyed, or removed, any such poor person or persons from one parish or
place to another, which shall adopt the provisions of this act, without
an order of removal from two justices of the peace for that purpose,
every person or persons so offending shall, for every such offence,
forfeit a sum not exceeding twenty pounds, nor less than five pounds.</p>

<p>At a General Meeting of the Justices of this County, together with
several discreet persons assembled by public advertisement,<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> on

(in pursuance of an order of the last Court of General Quarter Sessions)
for the purpose of rating Husbandry Wages, by the day or week, if then
approved of, [names of those present]....</p>

<p>Resolved unanimously,</p>

<p>That the present state of the Poor does require further assistance than
has been generally given them.</p>

<p>Resolved,</p>

<p>That it is not expedient for the Magistrates to grant that assistance by
regulating the Wages of Day Labourers, according to the directions of
the Statutes of the 5th Elizabeth and 1st James: But the Magistrates
very earnestly recommend to the Farmers and others throughout the
county, to increase the pay of their Labourers in proportion to the
present price of provisions; and agreeable thereto, the Magistrates now
present, have unanimously resolved that they will, in their several
divisions, make the following calculations and allowances for relief of
all poor and industrious men and their families, who to the satisfaction
of the Justices of their Parish, shall endeavour (as far as they can)
for their own support and maintenance.</p>

<p>That is to say,</p>

<p>When the Gallon Loaf of Second Flour, weighing 8lb. 11ozs. shall cost
1<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Then every poor and industrious man shall have for his own support 3<i>s.</i>
weekly, either produced by his own or his family's labour, or an
allowance from the poor rates, and for the support of his wife and every
other of his family, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>When the Gallon Loaf shall cost 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Then every poor and industrious man shall have 4<i>s.</i> weekly for his own,
and 1<i>s.</i> and 10<i>d.</i> for the support of every other of his family.</p>

<p>And so in proportion, as the price of bread rise or falls (that is to
say) 3<i>d.</i> to the man, and 1<i>d.</i> to every other of the family, on every
1<i>d.</i> which the loaf rise above 1<i>s.</i></p>

Vol. II, pp. 168-9</i>], 1797.</p>

<p><i>Stanhope (Durham).</i></p>

<p>The poor have been farmed for many years: about fifteen years ago they
were farmed for 250<i>l.</i>; but the expense has gradually increased since
that period: the year before last, the expense was 495<i>l.</i>, and last
year 494<i>l.</i>; and the Contractor says that he shall lose 100<i>l.</i> by his
last bargain, and will not take the poor this year under 700<i>l.</i>
Twenty-two poor people are at present in the house, and 100 families
receive weekly relief out of it: these out-poor, the Contractor says,
will cost him 450<i>l.</i> for the year ending at May-day next. The
Poor-house was built about fifteen years ago; it is, like most others in
the hands of contractors, in a dirty state.</p>

<p><i>Preston (Lancashire)</i><a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>.</p>

<p>The number of poor in the workhouse a few weeks ago, was as follows:&mdash;</p>




<table width="200" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="list">
<tr><td align='left'>Men</td><td align='right'>26</td></tr>

<tr><td align='left'></td><td align='right'>&mdash;</td></tr>
</table>


<p>At present there are 158 or 159 in the house. The number of out-poor at
present is 70; they cost about 10<i>l.</i> a week.</p>

<p>The workhouse is built on a tolerable plan, but wants apartments for the
sick. There are 4 or 5 beds in a room: the bedsteads are made of iron,
and the beds are stuffed with chaff: white-washing and other means of
keeping the house clean, seem rather neglected. It is said that about 15
die in a year in the house. About 20 acres of land were inclosed from
the common, for the use of the house, for keeping cows horses, and pigs;
raising potatoes, etc.: this plot of ground is much improved by
cultivation. Nothing is manufactured for the use of the house. The boys
and girls are employed in weaving calicoes, till they are able to earn
their living elsewhere. Old women wind cotton; a few, who can work,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[Pg 658]</a></span> are
employed in husbandry, gardening, and other occupations: no account of
their earnings could be obtained.</p>

<p><i>St. Martin-in-the-Fields</i> (<i>London</i>)<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>.</p>

<p>The poor of this parish are partly relieved at home, and partly
maintained in the workhouse in Castle-street, Leicester Fields. There
are, at present, about 240 weekly out-pensioners, besides a considerable
number of poor on the casual list. Of 573, the number of poor at present
in the workhouse, 473 are adults and 100 children; of which 54 are boys,
21 girls, able to work, and 25 infants. Their principal employment is
spinning flax, picking hair, carding wool, etc.; their annual earnings,
on an average of a few years past, amount to about &pound;150. It was once
attempted to establish a manufacture in the house; but the badness of
the situation for business, the want of room for workshops, and the
difficulty of compelling the able poor to pay proper attention to work,
rendered the project unsuccessful. Between 70 and 80 children belonging
to this parish are, generally, out at nurse in the country: a weekly
allowance of 3<i>s.</i> (lately advanced to 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>) is paid with each
child.</p>

<p>At 7 or 8 years of age, the children are taken into the house, and
taught a little reading, etc., for three or four years, and then put out
apprentices.</p>

<p><i>Bulcamp</i> (<i>Suffolk</i>)<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>.</p>

<p>The poor of 46 incorporated parishes in the hundred of Blything, are
maintained in a house of industry, which is situated on an eminence in
the parish of Bulcamp. The expense of erection was 12,000<i>l.</i>; the house
was opened for the reception of the poor in October, 1766. The whole
annual sum, to be paid by the parishes (which was fixed at the average
of seven years' expenditure, previous to their incorporation), was
3,084<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; in 1780 half the debt was paid off, and the
rates reduced one-eighth, or to 2,699<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>; in June, 1791,
the whole debt was discharged. The rates have been continued at the
reduced sum of 2,699<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> In 1793, the corporation found it
necessary to apply to Parliament for farther powers, relative to the
binding out poor children apprentices, which cost 350<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[Pg 659]</a></span></p>

<p>The work done in this house is chiefly spinning for the Norwich
manufacture: clothes and bedding, etc., for the house, are also made at
home. The following were the last week's earnings: an account of the
annual earnings could not be procured; but it appears that they have
been about 8<i>l.</i> a week, or 400<i>l.</i> a year, for several weeks past.</p>

<p>The number at present in the house is 40 men, 60 women, and 255
children: total 355.</p>

<p>The house is very roomy and convenient. The beds are chiefly of
feathers: the dormitories and other rooms are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[Pg 660]</a></span> kept very clean. More
work is done now than formerly; but owing to lowness of wages, the
receipts have decreased.</p>

<p>The number of deaths is very great, and, I presume, rather arises from
the number of old persons admitted into the house than from any
inattention towards the sick.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Winslow</i> (<i>Buckinghamshire</i>)</p>

<p>There seems to be a great want of employment: most of the labourers are
(as it is termed), on the Rounds; that is, they go to work from one
house to another round the parish. In winter sometimes 40 persons are on
the rounds. They are wholly paid by the parish, unless the householders
choose to employ them; and from these circumstances, labourers often
become very lazy, and imperious. Children, above ten years old, are put
on the rounds, and receive from the parish from 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> a
week.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Kibworth Beauchamp</i> (Leicestershire)<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>.</p>

<p>In the winter, and at other times, when a man is out of work, he applies
to the overseer, who sends him from house to house, to get employ: the
housekeeper, who employs him, is obliged to give him victuals, and 6<i>d.</i>
a day; and the parish adds 4<i>d.</i> (total, 10<i>d.</i> a day) for the support
of his family; persons working in this manner are called rounds-men,
from their going round the village or township for employ.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap"><a name="Another_Example_of_the_Roundsman_System" id="Another_Example_of_the_Roundsman_System"></a>Another Example of the Roundsman System</span> [<i>Thomas Batchelor,
The Agriculture of Bedfordshire (Agricultural Surveys), 1808, pp.
608-9</i>], 1808.</p>

<p><i>Bedfordshire.</i></p>

<p>The increase of population has caused a deficiency of employment, which
is so remarkable in some seasons, that a great proportion of the
labourers "go the rounds." This practice is not modern; but as it is not
supposed to be sanctioned by law, it may be proper to describe the
nature of it, and its general consequences. When a labourer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[Pg 661]</a></span> can obtain
no employment he applies to the acting overseer, from whom he passes on
to the different farmers all round the parish, being employed by each of
them after the rate of one day for every 20<i>l.</i> rent. The allowance to a
labourer on the rounds, is commonly 2<i>d.</i> per day below the pay of other
labourers, which is found to be a necessary check upon those who love
liberty better than labour. Boys receive from 4<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> per day on
the rounds, the whole of which is often repaid to the farmers by the
overseers. About half the pay of the men is returned in the same manner,
and the farmers often receive in this way the amount of from 2<i>d.</i> to
4<i>d.</i> in the pound rent, which consequently causes the apparent expense
of the poor to exceed the truth. The practice in question has a very bad
effect on the industry of the poor: they are often employed in trivial
business; the boys in particular are of little use in the winter season.
The men are careful not to earn more than they receive, and seem to
think it the safer extreme to perform too little rather than too much.</p>


<p>9. <span class="smcap"><a name="Report_of_the_Poor_Law_Commission" id="Report_of_the_Poor_Law_Commission"></a>Report of the Poor Law Commission</span> [<i>Report from Commission
on the Poor Laws, 1834 (XXVII), pp. 297, 228, 47, 261-262, 306-307</i>],
1834.</p>

<p>We recommend, therefore, the appointment of a Central Board to control
the administration of the Poor Laws; with such assistant Commissioners
as may be found requisite; and that the Commissioners be empowered and
directed to frame and enforce regulations for the government of
workhouses, and as to the nature and amount of the relief to be given
and the labour to be exacted in them, and that such regulations shall,
as far as may be practicable, be uniform throughout the country.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It may be assumed that in the administration of relief, the public is
warranted in imposing such conditions on the individual relieved, as are
conducive to the benefit either of the individual himself, or of the
country at large, at whose expense he is to be relieved.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>The first and most essential of all conditions, a principle which we
find universally admitted, even by those whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[Pg 662]</a></span> practice is at variance
with it, is that his situation on the whole shall not be made really or
apparently so eligible as the situation of the independent labourer of
the lowest class. Throughout the evidence it is shown, that in
proportion as the condition of any pauper is elevated above the
condition of independent labourers, the condition of the independent
class is depressed; their industry is impaired, their employment becomes
unsteady, and its remuneration in wages is diminished. Such persons,
therefore, are under the strongest inducements to quit the less eligible
class of labourers and enter the more eligible class of paupers. The
converse is the effect when the pauper class is placed in its proper
position, below the condition of the independent labourer. Every penny
bestowed, that tends to render the condition of the paupers more
eligible than that of the independent labourer, is a bounty on indolence
and vice. We have found, that as the poor's rates are at present
administered, they operate as bounties of this description to the amount
of several millions annually.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Another evil connected with out-door relief, and arising from its
undefined character, is the natural tendency to award to the deserving
more than is necessary, or where more than necessary relief is afforded
to all, to distinguish the deserving by extra allowances.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> ... The
whole evidence shows the danger of such an attempt. It appears that such
endeavours to constitute the distributors of relief into a tribunal for
the reward of merit, out of the property of others, have not only failed
in effecting the benevolent intentions of their promoters, but have
become sources of fraud on the part of the distributors, and of

<p>The chief specific measures which we recommend are:<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>First, that except as to medical attendance, and subject to the
exception respecting apprenticeship hereinafter stated, all relief
whatever to able-bodied persons or to their families, otherwise than in
well-regulated workhouses (<i>i.e.</i>, places where they may be set to work
according to the spirit and intention of the 43rd of Elizabeth), shall
be declared unlawful, and shall cease, in manner and at periods
hereafter specified; and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[Pg 663]</a></span> all relief afforded in respect of
children under the age of 16, shall be considered as afforded to their
parents.</p>

<p>At least four classes are necessary:<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>&mdash;(1) The aged and really
impotent; (2) The children; (3) The able-bodied females; (4) The
able-bodied males. Of whom we trust that the two latter will be the
least numerous classes. It appears to us that both the requisite
classification and the requisite superintendence may be better obtained
in separate buildings than under a single roof.... Each class might thus
receive an appropriate treatment; the old might enjoy their indulgences
without torment from the boisterous; the children be educated, and the
able-bodied subjected to such courses of labour and discipline as will
repel the indolent and vicious.</p>

<p>This section illustrates various departments of Government policy:
taxation and revenue (Nos. 1, 9 and 12), public debts (Nos. 7 and 10),
fiscal and trade policy (Nos. 1, 2, 4, 6, 13-17, 19), the coinage (Nos.
3, 5 and 8), and the national Bank (Nos. 7, 11, and 18). The specimens
of revenue policy begin with the Act by which Charles II abandoned
feudal dues in exchange for a general and hereditary excise (No. 1). The
principle involved in this transaction may be compared with Sir Robert
Walpole's remarks on the question of justice in taxation (No. 9) and
with Pitt's speech on introducing the Income Tax in 1798, which also
gives a survey of the whole financial position and a defence of the
policy of paying for wars out of hand (No. 12). The opposite policy, of
war-loans, had been adopted earlier, and the French wars of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries established the funding system. An
outline is given of the Sinking Fund by which it was supposed that this
national liability could be reduced while it was being created<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[Pg 668]</a></span> (No.
10). The foundation of the Bank of England (No. 7) was an important step
in the policy of national loans as well as an encouragement to the
growth of capital and capitalist industry. The French wars at the end of
the eighteenth century produced a crisis in the management of the Bank's
reserve; an official report explains the causes of the panic which led
to the suspension of cash payments and also shows the deliberate policy
by which the suspension was continued till 1819 (No. 11). This was the
first controversy of great importance on the subject of currency since
the seventeenth century, when the government of Charles II had adopted
the policy of allowing free export and free coinage of Gold and Silver
(Nos. 3 and 5). The gradual deterioration of the coinage which led to
the recoinage of 1696 is illustrated by a contemporary description (No.
8). The Bank Charter Act (No. 18) shows the financial aspect of rapid
national expansion in the nineteenth century and the method adopted to
give stability to credit by limiting the issue of unsupported paper
currency, in the period before the triumph of the cheque system.</p>

<p>The Navigation Act of Charles the second's reign (No. 2) formed part of
a system by which the State set itself to encourage particular
industries and took a part in the struggle for commercial leadership.
(See also Nos. 4 and 6.) The complications of this policy with
considerations of revenue and particular interests rapidly increased,
while the manufacturing export trade became more important (No. 13). A
reaction led by the Economists had begun in the latter part of the
eighteenth century. In the nineteenth century the battle raged over the
special protection successfully claimed by the Agricultural Interest in
the depression at the end of the Napoleonic wars (No. 15). The debates
and petitions (No. 14, No. 16, No. 19) bristle with the new Political
Economy. They also give an indication of the new social class created by
the Industrial Revolution and of the struggle of the landowners with the
North of England manufacturers who founded and financed the
Anti-Corn-Law League, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[Pg 669]</a></span> most successful of all political associations
for an economic object (No. 17).</p>

<p>For the increase of shipping and encouragement of the navigation of this
nation wherein, under the good providence and protection of God, the
wealth, safety and strength of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[Pg 671]</a></span> kingdom is so much concerned; be it
enacted by the King's most excellent majesty, and by the lords and
commons in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority
thereof, that from and after the first day of December one thousand six
hundred and sixty, and from thenceforward, no goods or commodities
whatsoever shall be imported into or exported out of any lands, islands,
plantations or territories to his Majesty belonging or in his
possession, or which may hereafter belong unto or be in the possession

England or Ireland, dominion of Wales or town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, or
are of the built of and belonging to any the said lands, islands,

and whereof the master and three-fourths of the mariners at least are
English.</p>

<p>And it is further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that no goods or

which are brought into England, Ireland, Wales, the islands of Guernsey
and Jersey, or town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, in English-built shipping, or
other shipping belonging to some of the aforesaid places, and navigated
by English mariners, as aforesaid, shall be shipped or brought from any
other place or places, country or countries, but only from those of the
said growth, production or manufacture, or from those ports where the
said goods and commodities can only, or are, or usually have been, first
shipped for transportation, and from none other places or countries.</p>

[<i>McCulloch, Tracts on Money,1856, pp. 145</i>], 1660.</p>

<p>Advice of his Majesty's Council of Trade, concerning the Exportation of
Gold and Silver in Foreign Coins and Bullion.</p>

<p class='center'>[Concluded Dec. 11, 1660.]</p>

<p>... Supposing that it were of absolute necessity to restrain all money
and bullion, once imported, to be kept within this kingdom. It then came
under consideration whether either the laws hitherto made in that behalf
are, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</a></span> that it be possible to make a law, adequate to prevent the
exportation thereof.</p>

<p>And here we were convinced, by experience, that the laws of this kingdom
(hitherto made) have been of no effect to the end thereby designed; and
looking abroad, as there are nowhere more strict and severe laws against
the exportation of coin and bullion than in Spain and France, we found
all to be to as little purpose.</p>

<p>We then, thirdly, enquired what loadstone attracted this metal by force
of nature to itself, against all human providence or prevention; and
soon found that it was alone the present course of trade and traffic
throughout the world....</p>

<p>And therefore, in the fourth place, we discovered that, as it is
impossible by any laws to restrain money and bullion against the use
that traffic finds for the same; so also the adhering to this principle
of restraining thereof discourageth, as well all natives as foreigners,
to import any money or bullion&mdash;where the exportation thereof is
forbidden them.</p>

<p>From whence, fifthly, the many advantages (thereby given away clearly to
the stranger from the English) present themselves; for the stranger,
knowing we must be furnished in one of these places for our occasions,
make us pay dearly for our accommodation.</p>

<p>So that, to wind up all that has been said, the result of the several
reasons and arguments herein summed up seemed to be this: that time and
experience instruct, and the present state of traffic throughout the
world require, that, for the increase of the stock of money in these
your Majesty's kingdoms, some way of liberty for the exportation, at
least of foreign coin and bullion, should be found out, and put in
execution; which hath produced the humble advice offered in the
preceding paper.</p>

<p class='center'><i>To the King's Most Excellent Majesty.</i></p>

<p><i>The Humble Remonstrance</i> of John Bland, of London, Merchant, on the
behalf of the Inhabitants and Planters of Virginia and Maryland.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[Pg 673]</a></span></p>

<p>Most humbly representing unto your Majesty the inevitable destruction of
these colonies, if so be that the late Act for increase of trade and
shipping be not as to them dispensed with; for it will not only ruinate
the inhabitants and planters, but make desolate the largest, fertilist,
and most glorious plantations under Your Majesty's Dominion; the which,
if otherwise suspended, will produce the greatest advantage to this
nation's commerce and considerablest income to Your Majesty's revenue,
that any part of the world doth to which we trade. [Rejoinder to
argument that the Dutch prohibit English trade with their Indian
Dominions. The American colonies are in need of customers. Why should
the Dutch be prevented from dealing with them?]</p>

<p>Virginia and Maryland are colonies, which though capable of better
commodities, yet for the present afford only these, tobacco chiefly,
then in the next place corn and cattle, commodities almost in every
country whatever to be had; withal they are such commodities, that
except purchased in these plantations so cheap as not elsewhere so to be
had, none would ever go thither to fetch them, no, not we ourselves.
Which being so, then certainly it cannot stand with wisdom to hinder the
Hollanders from going thither.</p>

<p>Then again, if you keep thence the Hollanders, can it be believed that
from England more ships will be sent than are able to bring thence what
tobacco England will spend? If they do bring more, must they not lose
both stock and block, principal and charges?...</p>

<p>A further prejudice doth evidently attend the commerce by this Act, not
only in debarring Hollanders from trading to these colonies, but thereby
we do likewise debar ourselves; for, by the Act, no English ships can
load any goods in Virginia and Maryland to transport to any country but
our own territories.... I demand then, if it would not be better to let
our English ships, loading in those colonies, to go whither they please,
and pay in the places where they do trade (if it will not be dispensed
with otherwise), the same customs to your Majesty as they should have
done in England, or give bills from thence to pay it in England?
Certainly this would be more beneficial to the commerce, and security
both for the ships and goods, and advantageous to your Majesty; for
whilst they are coming to England they might be at the end of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[Pg 674]</a></span>
intended voyages and obtain a market, which haply in England could not
be had....</p>

<p>If that notwithstanding what is by the foregoing particulars declared,
it may seem reasonable that the Act shall stand in force.... Then let me
on behalf of the said colonies of Virginia and Maryland make these
following proposals which I hope will appear but equitable; and I dare
undertake for them, that they will be very well satisfied, that those
few tobacconists that have engrossed that trade into their hands, shall
still continue in it without moving further against them therein.</p>

<p>First, that the traders to Virginia and Maryland from England shall
furnish and supply the planters and inhabitants of these colonies with
all sorts of commodities and necessaries which they may want or desire,
at as cheap rates and prices as the Hollanders used to have when the
Hollander was admitted to trade hither.</p>

<p>Secondly, that the said traders out of England to these colonies shall
not only buy of the planters such tobacco in the colonies as is fit for
England, but take off all that shall be yearly made by them, at as good
rates and prices as the Hollanders used to give....</p>

<p>By way of accommodation this I propose. Let all Hollanders and other
nations whatsoever freely trade into Virginia and Maryland, and bring
thither and carry thence whatever they please, and to counterpoise the
cheapness of their sailing, with dearness of our ships, to pay a set
duty and imposition that may countervail the same; and when what they
paid formerly will not do it, let it be doubled and trebled, as shall be
thought meet, yet still with this caution, that it may not make it as
bad as if they were totally prohibited.</p>

<p>In the next place, that all English ships that do go thither to trade,
and carry goods to any other country besides England, may be freed of
any custom there, more than some certain duty to the use of the
colonies....</p>

<p>Whereas it is most obvious that the plenty of current coins of gold and

Memoirs Relating to the Silver and Gold Coins of England (in Lansdowne
MSS, 801, British Museum</i>), <i>fs.</i> 33-48].</p>

<p>The silver money of England as well as the coins of all other countries
are liable to abuse by these three following methods:</p>

<p>1st, by alteration of the standard appointed by public authority.</p>

<p>2nd, by melting them down and converting the metal to other uses.</p>

<p>3rd, by exporting them into foreign countries, to carry on a trade.</p>

<p>And by all those methods was the whole stock of the cash of this kingdom
excessively impaired before the late grand coinage.</p>

<p>For 1st. the standard of our silver moneys appointed by the Government
was notoriously violated. By standard is here meant that particular
weight and fineness in the silver moneys which was settled by Queen
Elizabeth and continued all her time, and after it, through the reigns
of all her several successors down to her present Majesty, and was
lately confirmed by Act of Parliament....</p>

<p>These were the just weights, and the legal fineness of our silver moneys
coined with the hammer, of which sort the far greater part of the cash
of the whole kingdom did consist; but they were very liable to be
clipped and diminished in their weight, because very few of these pieces
were of a just assize when they first came out of the Mint. So many
pieces, I suppose, were by the Moneyers cut out of a bar of standard
silver, as did pretty exactly answer the pound weight Troy; and the tale
of the pieces required in that weight, by the Indenture of the Mint: but
though all the pieces together might come near the pound weight or be
within remedy; yet divers of them compared one with the other were very
disproportionable, as was too well known to many persons, who picked out
the heavy pieces, and threw them into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[Pg 678]</a></span> melting pot, to fit them for
exportation, or to supply the silver smiths.</p>

<p>[Pieces of hammered money, "though never clipped, did many of them in
their weight and value want or exceed the legal standard." Crowns varied
from 5<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> to 4<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, half-crowns from 3<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>,
etc.]</p>

<p>According to the best observation of Goldsmiths<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> and others the
clipping of our coins began to be discoverable in great receipts a
little after the Dutch war in 1672, but it made no great progress at
first for some years: and the silver moneys of Queen Elizabeth were very
little diminished.... But the yearly loss by clipping made terrible
advances every year from 1686.... In the later end of 1695<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> the
public loss upon all the clipped money then actually current (if one may
judge of the whole by the foregoing table) was at least 45 per cent. by
mere clipping and light counterfeit pieces, which upon the whole running
silver cash of the kingdom amounts to 2,250,000<i>l.</i><a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> ...</p>

<p>The whole kingdom was in a general distraction by the badness of the
silver coin and the rise of guineas, for no one knew what to trust to;
the landlord knew not in what to receive his rents, nor the tenant in
what to pay them. Neither of them could foretell the value of his moneys
to-morrow. The merchant could not foresee the worth of his wares at two
or three days distance, and was at a loss to set a price upon his goods.
Everybody was afraid to engage in any new contracts, and as shy in
performing old ones, the King subsisted his forces in foreign parts at
the disadvantage of seven or eight per cent. interest and five per cent.
premio for money borrowed here, besides the loss by the Exchange abroad:
and how to provide for the next year's expense, was a mystery.</p>

[<i>Parliamentary History (Cobbett), Vol. VIII, Col. 943</i>], 1732.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons. Debate on Sir Robert Walpole's motion for Salt
Duties. February 9, 1732.</i></p>

<p>Sir Robert Walpole stood up and spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker,</p>

<p>As there is nothing his Majesty has more at heart than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[Pg 679]</a></span> the giving all
possible ease to his subjects; so, whenever he is necessarily obliged to
desire assistance from them for the immediate support of the government,
he desires that they would choose those ways and means for raising the
annual supplies, which are least burthensome to the people, and which
makes the load fall equally upon the subjects in general. When money is
to be raised for the public good, for the security of all, he thinks
that every one ought to contribute his share, in proportion to the
benefit that he is thereby to receive.</p>

<p>As to the manner, sir, of raising taxes upon the people, it is a certain
maxim that that tax which is the most equal and the most general, is the
most just, and the least burthensome. Where every man contributes a
small share, a great sum may be raised for the public service, without
any man's being sensible of what he pays; whereas a small sum, raised
upon a few, lies heavy upon each particular man, and is the more
grievous, in that it is unjust; for where the benefit is mutual, the
expense ought to be in common. Of all the taxes I ever could think of,
there is not one more general nor one less felt, than that of the duty
upon salt. The duty upon salt is a tax that every man in the nation
contributes to according to his circumstances and condition in life;
every subject contributes something; if he be a poor man, he contributes
so small a trifle, it will hardly bear a name; if he be rich, he lives
more luxuriously, and consequently contributes more; and if he be a man
of a great estate, he keeps a great number of servants, and must
therefore contribute a great deal. Upon the other hand, there is no tax
that ever was laid upon the people of this nation, that is more unjust
and unequal than the Land Tax. The landholders bear but a small
proportion to the people of this nation, or of any nation; yet no man
contributes any the least share to this tax, but he that is possessed of
a land estate; and yet this tax has been continued without intermission
for above these 40 years.</p>

Bank of England, 1797 and 1826, in Reports 1826 (III), pp. 142 and
255-256</i>], 1797.</p>

<p>The alarm of Invasion [in 1796-1797] which, when an immediate attack was
first apprehended in Ireland, had occasioned some extraordinary demand
for cash on the Bank of England, in the months of December and January
last, began in February to produce similar results in the north of
England. Your Committee find, that in consequence of this apprehension,
the farmers suddenly brought the produce of their lands to sale, and
carried the notes of the County Banks, which they had collected by those
and other means, into those banks for payment; that this unusual and
sudden demand for cash reduced the several banks at Newcastle to the
necessity of suspending their payments in specie, and of availing
themselves of all the means in their power of procuring a speedy supply
of cash from the metropolis; that the effects of this demand on the
Newcastle banks and their suspension of payments in cash, soon spread
over various parts of the country, from whence similar applications were
consequently made to the metropolis for cash; that the alarm thus
diffused not only occasioned an increased demand for cash in the
country, but probably a disposition in many to hoard what was thus
obtained; that this call on the metropolis, through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[Pg 682]</a></span> whatever channels,
directly affected the Bank of England, as the great repository of cash,
and was in the course of still further operation upon it, when stopped
by the Minute of Council of the 26th of February.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Your Committee find, that the Court of Directors of the Bank did, on the
26th October 1797, come to a Resolution, a copy of which is subjoined to
this Report.</p>

<p>Your Committee, having further examined the Governor and Deputy
Governor, as to what may be meant by the political circumstances
mentioned in that resolution, find, that they understand by them, the
state of hostility in which the nation is still involved, and
particularly such apprehensions as may be entertained of invasion,
either in Ireland or in this country, together with the possibility
there may be of advances being to be made from this country to Ireland;
and that from these circumstances so explained, and from the nature of
the war, and the avowed purpose of the enemy to attack this country by
means of its public credit, and to distress it in its financial
operations, they are led to think that it will be expedient to continue
the restriction now subsisting, with the reserve for partial issues of
cash, at the discretion of the Bank, of the nature of that contained in
the present Acts; and that it may be so continued, without injury to the
credit of the Bank, and to the advantage of the nation.</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, that it is the opinion of this Court,<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> that the
Governor and Company of the Bank of England are enabled to issue Specie,
in any manner that may be deemed necessary for the accommodation of the
public; and the Court have no hesitation to declare that the affairs of
the Bank are in such a state, that it can with safety resume its
accustomed functions, if the political circumstances of the country do
not render it inexpedient: but the Directors deeming it foreign to their
province to judge of these points, wish to submit to the wisdom of
Parliament, whether, as it has been once judged proper to lay a
restriction on the payment of the bank in cash, it may, or may not, be
prudent to continue the same?"<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

edited W.S. Hathaway, 1806, Vol. III, pp. 282-333</i>], 1798.</p>

<p>I shall begin by stating what has been voted as the amount of the supply
under the head of the services for the navy, with the exception of what
is necessary for the transport services. All these accounts have this
day been laid before us; and it appears that the total sum for the
ordinaries and extra-ordinaries of the navy and transport services
amounts to 13,642,000<i>l.</i>, being the same sum, within a very small
amount, as was granted in the course of last session, and which I have
the satisfaction of assuring the committee is likely to prove sufficient
for the whole expenses of the navy, without leaving any necessity for
augmentation. The next head of expense is the army, in which the
estimates amount to 8,840,000<i>l.</i> ... Under the head of ordnance
services, including the expenses which have not been provided for, there
has been voted the sum of 1,570,000<i>l.</i> The next article is that of the
miscellaneous services. The plantation estimates have already been
voted, but there are other minuter parts of these services which have
not yet undergone a discussion in this house. The amount will be rather
less than it was last session. I state it [at] 600,000<i>l.</i> To this is to
be added the usual sum voted towards the redemption of the national
debt, above the annual million, which is 200,000<i>l.</i> There are other
sums, which are generally voted under the head of deficiency of grants.
Among these is a sum due for interest on treasury and exchequer bills
paid off, amounting to 565,000<i>l.</i>; the discount on prompt payments upon
the loan, amounting to 210,000<i>l.</i>; the interest on exchequer bills
circulated within the year, and charged upon the succeeding year,
300,000<i>l.</i>; in addition to this, there is the deficiency of the land
and malt in the act passed two years ago, amounting to 300,000<i>l.</i> These
sums swell the total of the supply to 29,272,000<i>l.</i> This total, sir,
does not differ in any material degree from the amount of the supply of
last session.</p>

<p>[He then estimates prospective sources of revenue:</p>

</table>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[Pg 684]</a></span>The remainder of the sum is that which must be raised either by a tax
within the year, in the same manner as the assessed tax bill of last
year, or by a loan. It will be to be considered, how the committee will
divide that remaining sum between them. The sum to be provided for is
upwards of twenty-three millions. Gentlemen will recollect that, in the
debates upon the subject of the assessed taxes last session, two
fundamental principles were established as the rule by which we should
be guided in providing for the supplies for the service of the year.
These were, first, to reduce the total amount to be at present raised by
a loan; and next, as far as it was not reducible, to reduce it to such a
limit, that no more loan should be raised than a temporary tax should
defray within a limited time. In the first place, the tax acceded to by
the House last session<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> was for the purpose of providing for the
supplies of the year; and in the next place, for the purpose of
extinguishing the loan raised in that year. From the modifications,
however, which that measure underwent after its being first proposed,
the produce of it was diminished to a considerable extent. Other means
indeed were adopted to remedy the deficiency which was thus occasioned.
The voluntary and cheerful efforts which, so honourably to individuals
and to the country, came in aid of the assessed taxes, and the superior
produce of the exports and imports beyond the estimate, brought the
amount of the sums raised to that at which they had been calculated. The
different articles were estimated at seven millions and a half, and this
sum was fully covered by the actual receipts under the distinct heads.
It gives me, indeed, the most heartfelt satisfaction to state, that
notwithstanding the difficulties which the measure encountered from the
shameful evasion, or rather the scandalous frauds by which its effects
were counteracted, the total amount which was expected has yet been
realized. The meanness which shrunk from fair and equal contribution has
been compensated to the public by the voluntary exertions of patriotism.
The produce of the assessed taxes, under all the modifications, and all
the evasions, is four millions. I had taken it at four and a half after
the modifications. The deficiency is supplied by the excess on head of
voluntary contributions....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[Pg 685]</a></span></p>

<p>Satisfactory as it must be to review the circumstances to which we owe
those advantages, and the benefits which the mode of raising the
supplies to a considerable extent adopted last session has produced, it
is unnecessary for me to state that, however the principle may deserve
our approbation, it is still much to be desired that its effects should
be more extensive, and its application more efficient.... Every
circumstance in our situation, every event in the retrospect of our
affairs, every thing which strikes our view as we look around us,
demonstrates the advantages of the system of raising a considerable part
of the supplies within the year, and ought to induce us to enforce it
more effectually to prevent those frauds, which an imperfect criterion
and a loose facility of modification have introduced; to repress those
evasions so disgraceful to the country, so injurious to those who
honourably discharge their equal contribution, and, above all, so
detrimental to the great object of national advantage which it is
intended to promote. In these sentiments, our leading principle should
be to guard against all evasion, to endeavour by a fair and strict
application to realize that full tenth, which it was the original
purpose of the measure of the assessed taxes to obtain, and to extend
this as far as possible in every direction, till it may be necessary
clearly to mark the modification, or to renounce, in certain instances,
the application of it altogether. If then, the committee assent to this
principle, they must feel the necessity of following it up by a more
comprehensive scale and by more efficient provisions. They will perceive
the necessity of obtaining a more specific statement of income, than the
loose scale of modification, which, under the former measure, permitted
such fraud and evasion. If such a provision be requisite to correct the
abuses of a collection, to obviate the artifices of dishonesty, to
extend the utility of the whole system, it will be found that many of
the regulations of the old measure will be adapted to a more
comprehensive and efficient application of the principle. If regulations
can be devised to prevent an undue abatement, and to proportion the
burden to the real ability, means must be employed to reach those
resources which, <i>prim&acirc; facie</i>, it is impossible under the present
system of the assessed taxes to touch. While inaccuracy, fraud,
inequality, be grievances which it is desirable to remedy, it will be an
additional satis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[Pg 686]</a></span>faction, that when compelled to adopt means to prevent
the defects of which we complain, we shall be enabled likewise to
improve and to extend the benefits we have obtained. The experience
which we have had upon the subject, proves that we must correct and
remedy, in order to secure the advantages which the measure is
calculated to afford. It is in our power to make them our own. I think I
can show that whatever benefit the principle upon which we have begun to
act, is fitted to bestow, may by a liberal, fair and efficient
application, be carried to an extent far greater than has yet been
obtained, an extent equal to every object of great and magnanimous
effort, to every purpose of national safety and glory, to every
advantage of permanent credit and of increased prosperity.</p>

<p>Impressed then with the importance of the subject, convinced that we
ought, as far as possible, to prevent all evasion and fraud, it remains
for us to consider, by what means these defects may be redressed, by
what means a more equal scale of contributions can be applied, and a
more extensive effect obtained. For this purpose it is my intention to
propose, that the presumption founded upon the assessed taxes shall be
laid aside, and that a general tax shall be imposed upon all the leading
branches of income. No scale of income indeed which can be devised will
be perfectly free from the objection of inequality, or entirely cut off
the possibility of evasion. All that can be attempted is, to approach as
near as circumstances will permit to a fair and equal contribution....
The details of a measure which attempts an end so great and important,
must necessarily require serious and mature deliberation. At present all
that I can pretend to do is, to lay before the committee an outline of
the plan which endeavours to combine every thing at which such a measure
ought to aim. This outline I shall now proceed to develop to the
committee as clearly and distinctly as I am able.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The next point for consideration then, is the mode of contribution which
shall be adopted. On this head it is my intention to propose that no
income under 60<i>l.</i> a year shall be called upon to contribute, and that
the scale of modification up to 200<i>l.</i> a year, as in assessed taxes,
shall be introduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[Pg 687]</a></span> with restriction. The quota which will then be
called for ought to amount to a full tenth of the contributor's income.
The mode proposed of obtaining this contribution differs from that
pursued in the assessed taxes, as instead of trebling their amount, the
statement of income is to proceed from the party himself.</p>

<p>[A detailed estimate of income from different sources follows. One-fifth
is deducted to allow for the remission of taxation on incomes under
60<i>l.</i> and graduation under 200<i>l.</i> from <small><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>120</sub></small> to <small><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub></small>.]</p>

<p>For the sake of greater clearness I will recapitulate the heads in the
same order that I have followed:&mdash;</p>




<table width="95%"  summary="estimate">

<p>Upon this sum a tax of 10 per cent. is likely to produce  10,000,000<i>l.</i>
a year, and this is the sum which is likely to result from the measure,
and at which I shall assume it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I trust that it will not be necessary for me to go into any detail of
argument to convince the committee of the advantages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[Pg 688]</a></span> of the beneficial
mode adopted last session, of raising a considerable part of the
supplies within the year.... It will be manifest to every gentleman on
the slightest consideration of the subject, that, in the end, the
measure of raising the supplies within the year is the cheapest and the
most salutary course that a wise people can pursue; and when it is
considered that there is a saving of at least one-twelfth upon all that
is raised, gentlemen will not suffer a superstitious fear, and jealousy
of the danger of exposing the secrecy of income, to combat with a
measure that is so pregnant with benefits to the nation. If gentlemen
will take into their consideration the probable duration of peace and
war, calculated from the experience of past times, they will be
convinced of the immeasurable importance of striving to raise the
supplies within the year, rather than accumulating a permanent debt. The
experience of the last hundred, fifty, or forty years, will show how
little confidence we can have in the duration of peace, and it ought to
convince us how important it is to establish a system that will prepare
us for every emergency, give stability to strength, and perpetual
renovations to resource. I think I could make it apparent to gentlemen
that in any war, of the duration of six years, the plan of funding all
the expenses to be incurred in carrying it on, would leave at the end of
it a greater burden permanently upon the nation than would be sustained,
than they would have to incur for the six years only of its continuance,
and one year beyond it, provided that they made the sacrifice of a tenth
of their income. In the old, unwise, and destructive way of raising the
supplies by a permanent fund, without any provision for its redemption,
a war so carried on entails the burden upon the age and upon their
posterity for ever. This has, to be sure, in a great measure, been done
away and corrected, by the salutary and valuable system which has been
adopted of the redemption fund. But that fund cannot accomplish the end
in a shorter period than forty years, and during all that time the
expenses of a war so funded must weigh down and press upon the people.
If, on the contrary, it had at an earlier period of our history been
resolved to adopt the present mode of raising the supplies within the
year; if, for instance, after the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, the scheme
of redemption had been adopted and persevered in to this time, we should
not now, for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[Pg 689]</a></span> seventh year of the war, have had more to raise from
the pockets of the people than what we have now to pay of permanent
taxes, together with about a fourth of what it would be necessary to lay
on in addition for this year. Fortunately, we have at last established
the redemption fund: the benefits of it are already felt; they will
every year be more and more acknowledged; and in addition to this it is
only necessary, that instead of consulting a present advantage, and
throwing the burden, as heretofore, upon posterity, we shall fairly meet
it ourselves, and lay the foundation of a system that shall make us
independent of all the future events of the world.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>[Evidence of Joseph Shaw, Chairman of Birmingham Chamber of Foreign
Commerce and exporter of hardwares.]</p>

<p>Have you had occasion to make any estimate, founded upon your own
inquiries, of the number of workmen employed in the Birmingham
manufactory<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>&mdash;and the neighbouring towns? I never particularly
estimated for the whole of them, but in the year 1808 I took an estimate
of the people employed in the American trade.... Those that could be
ascertained to be (as nearly as could be) exclusively employed in the
American trade were 50,000, exclusive of the nail trade, which employed
from twenty to thirty thousand [of whom two-thirds were engaged in the
American trade].</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Can you state to the Committee, from your observation, what proportion
the foreign trade generally bears to the trade for home consumption?...
I should think it was considerably more than one half, including the
United States.</p>

<p>Do you think it would amount to two-thirds? I should think not far from
it.... Do you think the foreign trade is equal to two-thirds of the
whole manufacture?&mdash;When the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[Pg 690]</a></span> foreign trade is the same as in the year
1810, not in its present state; it is now very different....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>To what cause do you ascribe the diminution of your trade to the
Continent?&mdash;The risk of sending goods into many ports of the Continent
is too great....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Then it is the French, Berlin, and other decrees that have produced this
diminution of your trade to the Continent?&mdash;To my own particular trade.
I cannot say how it is as to others.</p>


<p>[Evidence of John Bailey, exporter and home factor of Sheffield goods.]</p>

<p>What are the principal articles manufactured at Sheffield?&mdash;They are
very numerous, I can present a list of them to the House; the principal
articles are cutlery, files, edged tools, saws, and a great variety of
other heavy articles.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Can you speak to the population of Sheffield, and such parts of the
neighbouring parishes as are concerned in the Sheffield
manufacture?&mdash;The population of the parish of Sheffield, as returned by
the overseers in the year 1811, was 53,000 odd; but including those
parts of parishes in which Sheffield goods are manufactured, the
population amounts to 60,000 at least.</p>

<p>Can you tell what proportion of hands are employed in manufacturing for
the American market?&mdash;For the American market, about 4,000 male adults,
and 2,000 women and children, making a total of 6,000.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>How many do you estimate are employed in manufacturing for the home
trade?&mdash;Six thousand male adults, and one thousand women and children.</p>

<p>How many do you calculate are employed in the remaining parts of the
Sheffield trade, namely, manufactures for the foreign market, exclusive
of the American?&mdash;Two thousand male adults, and one thousand women and
children.</p>

<p>This last market includes Spain and Portugal?&mdash;Spain, Portugal, the West
Indies, South America, and Canada, with some few other parts.</p>

<p>What proportion does the American market bear to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[Pg 691]</a></span> home market, as
far as regards the Sheffield goods?&mdash;The American exports amount, as
nearly as I have been able to ascertain, to one-third of the whole
manufactures of Sheffield; the home trade to, I think, three-sixths.</p>

<p>[He adds that the American trade had been affected by the Orders in
Council and the Non-importation Act of the United States. The home trade
with towns in the American trade had been injured also. Goods to the
value of &pound;400,000 were waiting in Sheffield and Liverpool warehouses.]</p>

<p>[Evidence of Robert MacKerrell, London merchant, dealing in cottons and
muslins, and manufacturer of Paisley.]</p>

<p>Can you inform the Committee what the state of the trade was in the
years 1808, 1809, 1810, and 1811?&mdash;In 1807 we felt the whole effect of
the Berlin decree, we were entirely excluded from the Continent; I speak
with regard to my own transactions and those of a vast number of my
friends. We had in 1807, and previous to that, trades to the South of
Europe, particularly in Portugal, which were uninterrupted, but which
were likewise put an end to by the French invasion in November of that
year. In 1808 the trade revived considerably; a great quantity of our
goods, and of English merchandise, was introduced into the Continent
through Heligoland; considerable exports were made to the Baltic; the
trade in the Mediterranean increased very considerably; a very great
trade was opened to this country in consequence of the Royal Family of
Portugal removing to the Brazils, which likewise made an opening to
Spanish South America. In 1809 the trade through Heligoland was most
extensive; Bonaparte had his hands full with the Emperor of Germany and
with the Spaniards, and had no time to attend to the coast; the trade
during that year I may say was uninterrupted. The trade to the
Mediterranean increased very much; the quantity of goods taken out that
year greatly exceeded any previous year, for reasons that at that time
we could not account for. The trade to the Brazils was equally extensive
with the year before, vast exportations took place to South America, and
in general, trade in the line in which I am engaged was reckoned a fair
trade; the markets were never heavy.</p>

<p>[The Orders in Council increased the English export trade to the South
of Europe, and Africa and the Levant were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[Pg 692]</a></span> supplied with English
substitutes for Continental cottons and linens.]</p>

<p>What has been the state of your trade for the last eighteen months, and,
as far as you have been informed, of the country in general?&mdash;The state
of the trade during the last eighteen months has been depressed; for the
last twelve months it has been recovering, but for the six months
previous it was very much depressed indeed.</p>

<p>To what do you attribute that depression?&mdash;We attribute the depression
of trade which took place to the effect of the Berlin and Milan decrees.
[Northern Europe, the Baltic, etc., were shut against English trade, and
English ships were sequestered even in Swedish ports.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">14. <a name="Debate_on_the_Corn_Law" id="Debate_on_the_Corn_Law"></a>Debate on the Corn Law</span> [<i>Parliamentary History, 1st Series,
Vol. XXIX, Cols. 798-818</i>], 1815.</p>

<p class='center'><i>House of Commons. February 17, 1815.</i></p>

<p class='center'><i>The State of the Corn Laws.</i></p>

<p>The <i>Hon. Frederick Robinson</i> immediately rose.... He had never
disguised from himself, and he was not ashamed to confess it, the
extreme difficulty, as well as the extreme importance, of this question.
He could not, however, but feel that the prejudices on this subject had,
from further inquiry, been very much removed. But, above all, he was
happy to see that the misrepresentations, for so he thought they were,
with respect to the motives of those who supported this measure, and
with reference to the effects which it was likely to produce, were done
away with. There did not now exist in the public mind the feeling by
which it was before influenced. It was not now supposed that the object
sought to be accomplished by the alteration of the corn law was the mean
and base and paltry one of getting, for a particular class of society, a
certain profit at the expense of the rest. "For my part," said Mr.
Robinson, "I declare to God, if I thought this was the motive which
actuated any individual who supported the alteration; and, above all, if
I conceived that such would be the effect of the measure, no
consideration on earth could tempt me to bring it forward." ...</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[Pg 693]</a></span></p><p>... The general result of his reasoning was, in the first place, that
it was quite impossible for us safely to rely on a foreign import. If
they so did, a necessary result would be a diminution of our own
produce, which would become more and more extensive every year, and
consequently call for a greater annual supply from foreign countries&mdash;a
supply which must progressively increase as the agriculture of the
kingdom became less encouraged; and that, when the fatal moment arrived,
the system of foreign supply would prove completely illusory.</p>

<p>The next point to be considered was the extent to which protection
should be given. That was a point on which, undoubtedly, a difference of
opinion was most likely to prevail. Some gentlemen would be for going
considerably higher than others. Many thought the prohibition ought to
be carried to a price considerably above that, without he obtained which
it was conceived the agriculturalist could not cultivate. Others would
wish that it should be placed much lower; and contend that because a
particular species and degree of burden was likely to be removed, the
protecting price ought to be much reduced. Now he would be inclined to
agree to the first of these propositions, if the necessary effect of it
would not be to bring up the price of corn to the highest possible rate,
within the limits of the sum at which importation should commence. This
certainly might be the case at the first moment, but he believed the
ultimate result would not be so. He thought the final effect of the
system would be to give such a powerful support to our own agriculture
as would greatly increase the general produce of the country. It would
excite a strong competition between the different parts of England, and
between England and Ireland; so that the growth of corn, if Providence
blessed us with favourable seasons, would be sufficiently large to
afford an ample supply for the people of this country, and would enable
them to be fed at a much cheaper rate, in the long run, than could be
effected by the adoption of any other system.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Mr. Philips</i> professed himself equally inclined either to proceed with,
or defer the discussion, as might be most agreeable to the wishes of the
House. Several members calling out "Go on," he began by stating his
entire concurrence in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[Pg 694]</a></span> opinion of the right hon. gentleman who had
moved the resolutions, that this was not a question on which the
interests of the commercial and agricultural classes were at variance,
but one in which those interests, when fairly and liberally considered,
would be found to accord; for no resolution upon it calculated to
promote the general prosperity of the country could be adopted without
materially benefiting both classes. But if this were not the case, if
the question were one in which the interests of two or more descriptions
of our fellow-subjects were opposed, he should say that it was the duty
of parliament not to legislate for the advantage of one class in
contradistinction to, or at the expense of another, but to legislate for
the benefit of the whole community. Looking at the question under the
influence of this principle, he could not help feeling and expressing
some surprise at the occasion of their present deliberations. What was
the object of their deliberations? To provide a remedy for the low price
of corn. That which all ages and countries had considered as a great
national benefit was now discovered to be a great evil, against which we
were imperiously called to legislate in self-defence. The real object of
the resolutions, however disguised and disavowed, was to raise the price
of corn. [Here Mr. Robinson expressed his dissent.] Mr. Philips
proceeded to say that this not only was their object, but if that object
were not attained, the advocates of the resolutions would regard them as
nugatory. The right hon. gentleman must at least allow that their object
was to raise the present price of grain; but he contended that
moderation and uniformity of price would be their ultimate effect. It
did seem somewhat inconsistent, on the part of the hon. gentleman, to
tell the House that the effectual way to lower price was to acquiesce in
a measure expressly intended to raise it. But how are this moderation
and uniformity of price to be produced? By contracting the market of
supply. Thus, while in all other instances moderation and uniformity of
price are found to be in proportion to the extent of the market of
supply, in the instance of corn they are to be in proportion to the
limitation of it: and in a commodity peculiarly liable to be affected by
the variation of seasons, moderation and uniformity of price, and
abundance, are to be attained by preventing importations from foreign
countries correcting the effect of varieties of climate, and of a scanty
harvest in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[Pg 695]</a></span> our own. To him it appeared that no measure could be better
calculated to produce directly opposite consequences.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In considering the relation between the price of provisions and of
labour, Mr. Philips observed that it was necessary to distinguish the
countries and the trades from which examples were taken. In a new
country where the value of land is extremely low, and agriculture
rapidly progressive, in a new and thriving manufacture, the price of
labour may be so high in proportion to that of the necessaries of life
as to be little affected by their fluctuations.... But this state of
things cannot exist in old manufactures, such as those generally
established in this country, where competition has reduced profits, and
that reduction of profit has brought the wages of the labourer to a
level with his subsistence in tolerable comfort. In such manufactures if
you raise the price of provisions without proportionately raising that
of labour, to what privations and evils must you necessarily expose the
labourer! He was ready to admit with the noble lord<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> that, <i>ceteris
paribus</i>, the immediate effect of a high advance of provisions might
probably be a reduction of the price of labour; because labourers being
desirous of obtaining the same comforts that they had been used to,
might be stimulated to more diligence. They might work sixteen hours a
day instead of ten, and thus the competition for employment being
increased among the same number of workmen, without any increase of
demand, the price of labour might fall. But will any person contend that
this state of affairs can long continue? The labourer must go to the
parish, or turn to some more profitable employment, if by chance any can
be found, or he must emigrate, or work himself out by overstrained
exertion. The proportion being then altered between the demand for
labour and the supply, its price will rise. This effect sooner or later
must happen, but till it has actually taken place how dreadful must be
the situation of the labourer!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Having thus shown both by reasoning and by reference to facts, that the
price of provisions must ultimately and on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[Pg 696]</a></span> the average regulate that of
labour, he proceeded to show the effect that an advance of provisions
must have on our manufacturing interests. And here Mr. Philips said that
he wished on such topics, to reduce his reasoning as much as possible to
numerical calculation. He would suppose, for the sake of argument,
without at all entering into the enquiry, that three-fifths, or 60 per
cent. of the labourer's wages were spent in provisions, and that
provisions were 80 per cent. dearer here than they were in France, or
any manufacturing country on the continent. By multiplying 60 by 80, and
dividing by 100, the committee would see that the excess of the price of
labour here above that of France would, from these datas, and according
to his reasoning, be 48 per cent. He wished the committee to consider
what must be the effect of such an excessive price of labour employed in
our manufactures, when compared with the low price of labour employed in
the manufactures of France, and what an advantage it must give to the
French manufacturers in their attempts to rival us on the continent.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>[After quoting Malthus] he observed that there were two ways of
equalising subsistence and population, one by increasing food, the other
by limiting population, and warned the committee against being led into
measures whose tendency might be to produce that effect in the latter
way. Why (said Mr. Philips) should a commercial and manufacturing
country like this have such a jealousy and dread of the importation of
corn? An importation of corn cannot take place without a corresponding
export of commodities on which British industry has been employed. The
export will increase your wealth, that wealth will increase your
population, and that increased population will produce an increased
demand for your agricultural produce.... Mr. Philips observed that no
country in the world was so interested as this in establishing the
principle of free trade, because no other country could profit equally
by the general recognition of that principle. Foreign nations,
mistaking, like the advocates of the regulation before the committee,
the circumstances which have operated against our wealth for the causes
of it, are now following our example. They are prohibiting or imposing
restraints on the import of our fabrics, in order to encourage their own
manu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[Pg 697]</a></span>factures, from which they will receive inferior fabrics at a higher
price. Let us convince them, by an example, of their mistake. Let us
convince them that by leaving industry and enterprise unfettered, and by
allowing capital to take its natural and voluntary direction, we are
persuaded that the true interests of this country and of every other
will be most effectually promoted.</p>

<p>Mr. Philips proceeded to say that Great Britain was geographically a
commercial country, that commerce had stimulated her agriculture rather
than agriculture had stimulated her commerce. It had given wealth to her
people, and diffused fertility over her soil. Take care, said he, that
in attempting to change the natural character of your country, you do
not stop the progress of national prosperity....</p>

continue to be made up and published in any manner now required by law;
but that if it shall hereafter at any time after the importation of
foreign corn, meal or flour shall be permitted, under the provisions of
this Act, appear that the average prices of the different sorts of
British corn respectively in the six weeks immediately succeeding the
fifteenth day of February, the fifteenth day of May, the fifteenth day
of August and the fifteenth day of November in each year, shall have
fallen below the prices at which foreign corn, meal or flour may be,
under the provisions of this Act, allowed to be imported for home
consumption, no such foreign corn, meal or flour shall be allowed to be
imported into the United Kingdom for home consumption from any place
between the rivers Eyder and Bidassoa, both inclusive, until a new
average shall be made up and published in the London Gazette for
regulating the importation into the United Kingdom for the succeeding
quarter.</p>

1820.</p>

<p>
The Petition, etc.,<br />
Humbly sheweth<br />
</p>

<p>That foreign commerce is eminently conducive to the wealth and
prosperity of a country, by enabling it to import the commodities for
the production of which the soil, climate, capital, and industry of
other countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those
articles for which its own situation is better adapted.</p>

<p>That freedom from restraint is calculated to give the utmost extension
to foreign trade, and the best direction to the capital and industry of
the country.</p>

<p>That the maxim of buying in the cheapest market and selling in the
dearest, which regulates every merchant in his individual dealings, is
strictly applicable as the best rule for the trade of the whole nation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[Pg 699]</a></span></p>

<p>That a policy founded on these principles would render the commerce of
the world an interchange of mutual advantages, and diffuse an increase
of wealth and enjoyments among the inhabitants of each State.</p>

<p>That, unfortunately, a policy the very reverse of this has been, and is,
more or less, adopted and acted upon by the Government of this and of
every other country....</p>

<p>That the prevailing prejudices in favour of the protective or
restrictive system may be traced to the erroneous supposition that every
importation of foreign commodities occasions a diminution or
discouragement of our own productions to the same extent, whereas it may
be clearly shown that although the particular description of production
which could not stand against unrestrained foreign competition would be
discouraged, yet, as no importation could be continued for any length of
time without a corresponding exportation, direct or indirect, there
would be an encouragement, for the purpose of that exportation, of some
other production to which our situation might be better suited, thus
affording at least an equal, and probably a greater, and certainly a
more beneficial employment to our own capital and labour.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>That, among the other evils of the restrictive or protective system, not
the least is, that the artificial protection of one branch of industry,
or source of production, against foreign competition, is set up as a
ground of claim by other branches for similar protection, so that if the
reasoning upon which these restrictive or prohibitory regulations are
founded were followed out consistently, it would not stop short of
excluding us from all foreign commerce whatsoever. And the same train of
argument, which, with corresponding prohibitions and protective duties,
should exclude us from foreign trade, might be brought forward to
justify the re-enactment of restrictions upon the interchange of
productions (unconnected with public revenue) among the kingdoms
composing the union, or among the counties of the same kingdom.</p>

<p>That an investigation of the effects of the restrictive system at this
time is peculiarly called for, as it may, in the opinions of your
petitioners, lead to a strong presumption that the distress which now so
generally prevails is considerably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[Pg 700]</a></span> aggravated by that system, and that
some relief may be obtained by the earliest practicable removal of such
of the restraints as may be shown to be most injurious to the capital
and industry of the community, and to be attended with no compensating
benefit to the public revenue.</p>

<p>That a declaration against the anti-commercial principles of our
restrictive system is of the more importance at the present juncture
inasmuch as, in several instances of recent occurrence, the merchants
and manufacturers in foreign States have assailed their respective
Governments with applications for further protective or prohibitory
duties and regulations, urging the example and authority of this
country, against which they are almost exclusively directed, as a
sanction for the policy of such measures. And certainly, if the
reasoning upon which our restrictions have been defended is worth
anything, it will apply in behalf of the regulations of foreign States
against us. They insist upon our superiority in capital and machinery,
as we do upon their comparative exemption from taxation, and with equal
foundation.</p>

<p>That nothing would more tend to counteract the commercial hostility of
foreign States than the adoption of a more enlightened and more
conciliatory policy on the part of this country.</p>

<p>That, although, as a matter of mere diplomacy, it may sometimes answer
to hold out the removal of particular prohibitions, or high duties, as
depending upon corresponding concessions by other States in our favour,
it does not follow that we should maintain our restrictions in cases
where the desired concessions on their part cannot be obtained. Our
restrictions would not be the less prejudicial to our capital and
industry because other Governments persisted in preserving impolitic
regulations.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>That in thus declaring, as your petitioners do, their conviction of the
impolicy and injustice of the restrictive system, and in desiring every
practicable relaxation of it, they have in view only such parts of it as
are not connected, or are only subordinately so, with the public
revenue. As long as the necessity for the present amount of revenue
subsists, your petitioners cannot expect so important a branch of it as
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[Pg 701]</a></span> Customs to be given up, nor to be materially diminished, unless
some substitute, less objectionable, be suggested. But it is against
every restrictive regulation of trade not essential to the
revenue&mdash;against all duties merely protective from foreign
competition&mdash;and against the excess of such duties as are partly for the
purpose of revenue and partly for that of protection, that the prayer of
the present petition is respectfully submitted to the wisdom of
Parliament.</p>

Anti-Corn-Law League by Archibald Prentice, I, pp. 101-2, 1853</i>], 1839.</p>

<p><i>Resolutions of meeting of delegates at Manchester, January 23, 1839.</i></p>

<p>Resolved&mdash;1. That this meeting of representatives from all the great
sections of our manufacturing and commercial population, solemnly
declare it to be their conviction that the prosperity of the great
staples upon which their capital and industry are employed, is in
imminent danger from the operation of the laws which interdict or
interfere with the exchange of their productions for the corn and other
produce of foreign nations, and thus check our trade, and artificially
enhance the price of food in this country; and believing that the facts
upon which this judgment is formed are little known, and of such
national importance as to call for their disclosure before the people's
representatives, they earnestly recommend that petitions be immediately
forwarded from all parts of the Kingdom, praying to be heard by counsel
and evidence at the bar of the House of Commons in the approaching
session of Parliament.</p>

<p>2. That in order to secure unity and efficiency of action this meeting
recommends that delegates be appointed by the several Anti-Corn-Law
Associations of the kingdom. Those manufacturing and commercial towns
not already possessing such societies are earnestly recommended to form
Anti-Corn-Law Associations; and in case they require information or
advice, they are invited to put themselves immediately in correspondence
with the Manchester Association, whose fundamental rule, prohibiting the
discussion of any party or political topics, is especially recommended
for the adoption of all similar bodies elsewhere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[Pg 702]</a></span></p>

<p>3. That the agricultural proprietor, capitalist, and labourer are
benefited equally with the trader, by the creation and circulation of
the wealth of the country; and this meeting appeals to all those classes
to co-operate for the removal of a monopoly which, by restricting the
foreign commerce of the country, retards the increase of the population,
and restrains the growth of towns; thus depriving them of the manifold
resources to be derived from the augmenting numbers and wealth of the
country.</p>

<p>4. That this meeting cannot separate without expressing its deep
sympathy with the present privations of that great and valuable class of
their countrymen who earn their daily bread by the sweat of their brow;
many of whom are now suffering from hunger in the midst of boundless
fields of employment, rendered unproductive solely by those unjust laws
which prevent the exchange of the products of their industry for the
food of other countries. So long as a plentiful supply of the first
necessaries of life is denied by acts of the British legislation to the
great body of the nation, so long will the government and the country be
justly exposed to all the evils resulting from the discontent of the
people. With a view to avert so great a danger by an act of universal
justice, this meeting pledges itself to a united, energetic, and
persevering effort for the total and immediate repeal of all laws
affecting the free importation of grain.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

Series, Vol. 73, Cols. 68, 69-71, 849-850, 1345-1347</i>], 1846.</p>

<p><i>Address in Answer to Her Majesty's Speech, January 22nd, 1846.</i></p>

<p>
<i>House of Commons.</i></p>
<p class='center'><i>Sir Robert Peel.</i>
</p>

<p>Sir, the immediate cause which led to the dissolution of the Government
in the early part of last December, was that great and mysterious
calamity which caused a lamentable failure in an article of food on
which great numbers of the people in this part of the United Kingdom,
and still larger numbers in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[Pg 706]</a></span> sister kingdom, depended mainly for
their subsistence. That was the immediate and proximate cause, which led
to the dissolution of the Government. But it would be unfair and
uncandid on my part, if I attached undue importance to that particular
cause. It certainly appeared to me to preclude further delay, and to
require immediate decision&mdash;decision not only upon the measures which it
was necessary at the time to adopt, but also as to the course to be
ultimately taken with regard to the laws which govern the importation of
grain. I will not assign to that cause too much weight. I will not
withhold the homage which is due to the progress of reason and to truth,
by denying that my opinions on the subject of protection have undergone
a change.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Sir, those who contend for the removal of impediments upon the import of
a great article of subsistence, such as corn, start with an immense
advantage in the argument. The natural presumption is in favour of free
and unrestricted importation. It may, indeed, be possible to combat that
presumption; it may be possible to meet its advocates in the field of
argument, by showing that there are other and greater advantages arising
out of the system of prohibition than out of the system of unrestricted
intercourse; but even those who so contend will, I think, admit that the
natural feelings of mankind are strongly in favour of the absence of all
restriction, and that the presumption is so strong, that we must combat
it by an avowal of some great public danger to be avoided, or some great
public benefit to be obtained by restriction on the importation of food.
We all admit that the argument in favour of high protection or
prohibition on the ground that it is for the benefit of a particular
class, is untenable. The most strenuous advocates for protection have
abandoned that argument; they rest, and wisely rest, the defence of
protective duties upon higher principles. They have alleged, as I have
myself alleged, that there were public reasons for retaining this
protection. Sir, circumstances made it absolutely necessary for me,
occupying the public station I do, and seeing the duty that must
unavoidably devolve on me&mdash;it became absolutely necessary for me
maturely to consider whether the grounds on which an alteration of the
Corn Laws can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[Pg 707]</a></span> resisted are tenable. The arguments in favour of
protection must be based either on the principle that protection to
domestic industry is in itself sound policy, and that, therefore,
agriculture, being a branch of domestic industry, is entitled to share
in that protection; or, that in a country like ours, encumbered with an
enormous load of debt, and subject to great taxation, it is necessary
that domestic industry should be protected from competition with
foreigners; or, again&mdash;the interests of the great body of the community,
the laborious classes, being committed in this question&mdash;that the rate
of wages varies with the price of provisions, that high prices imply
high wages, and that low wages are the concomitants of low prices.
Further, it may be said, that the land is entitled to protection on
account of some peculiar burdens which it bears. But that is a question
of justice rather than of policy; I have always felt and maintained that
the land is subject to peculiar burdens; but you have the power of
weakening the force of that argument by the removal of the burden, or
making compensation. The first three objections to the removal of
protection are objections founded on considerations of public policy.
The last is a question of justice, which may be determined by giving
some counterbalancing advantage. Now, I want not to deprive those who,
arguing <i>a priori</i>, without the benefit of experience, have come to the
conclusion that protection is objectionable in principle&mdash;I want not to
deprive them of any of the credit which is fairly their due. Reason,
unaided by experience, brought conviction to their minds. My opinions
have been modified by the experience of the last three years. I have had
the means and opportunity of comparing the results of periods of
abundance and low prices with periods of scarcity and high prices. I
have carefully watched the effects of the one system, and of the
other&mdash;first, of the policy we have been steadily pursuing for some
years, viz., the removal of protection from domestic industry; and next,
of the policy which the friends of protection recommend. I have also had
an opportunity of marking from day to day the effect upon great social
interests of freedom of trade and comparative abundance. I have not
failed to note the results of preceding years, and to contrast them with
the results of the last three years; and I am led to the conclusion that
the main grounds of public policy on which protection has been defended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[Pg 708]</a></span>
are not tenable; at least, I cannot maintain them. I do not believe,
after the experience of the last three years, that the rate of wages
varies with the price of food. I do not believe that with high prices,
wages will necessarily rise in the same ratio. I do not believe that a
low price of food necessarily implies a low rate of wages. Neither can I
maintain that protection to domestic industry is necessarily good.</p>

<p class='center'><i>Adjourned Debate. February 13, 1846.</i></p>

<p class='center'><i>House of Commons.</i></p>

<p class='center'><span class="smcap">Sir Douglas Howard</span> said:<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

 <hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I have often imagined&mdash;and it was for this that I moved for, and
obtained the order of this House for, the extensive returns which are
now preparing, namely, the various colonial tariffs and commercial
relations at present subsisting between all the Colonies of the Empire
and the mother country, and between the Colonies themselves&mdash;that it
might really be possible to treat Colonies like counties of the country,
not only in direct trade with the United Kingdom, but in commercial
intercourse with each other, by free trade among ourselves, under a
reasonable moderate degree of protection from without, and so resolve
the United Kingdom, and all her Colonies and possessions, into a
commercial union such as might defy all rivalry, and defeat all
combinations. Then might colonization proceed on a gigantic scale&mdash;then
might British capital animate British labour, on British soil, for
British objects, throughout the extended dominions of the British
Empire. Such an union is the United States of America&mdash;a confederation
of sovereign States, leagued together for commercial and political
purposes, with the most perfect free trade within, and a stringent
protection from without; and signally, surely, has that commercial
league succeeded and flourished. Such an union, too, is the German
Customs League; and it has succeeded to an extent that really is, in so
short a time, miraculous. But free trade&mdash;the extinction of the
protective principle&mdash;the repeal of the differential duties&mdash;would at
once convert all our Colonies, in a commercial sense, into as many
independent States. The colonial consumer of British produc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[Pg 709]</a></span>tions would
then be released from his part of the compact&mdash;that of dealing, in
preference, with the British producer; and the British consumer of such
articles as the Colonies produce, absolved from his; each party would be
free to buy in the cheapest, and sell in the dearest market. I defy any
hon. member opposite to say that this would not be a virtual dissolution
of the colonial system.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I have now nearly concluded the observations which I shall address to
the House. I have omitted a great deal which I wished to urge upon the
House; and I sincerely wish that what I have said had been urged with
more ability; but I have endeavoured not to make a mere Corn Law speech;
I have only taken corn as an illustration; but I don't like my friends
here to enter upon that Corn Law debate which I suppose is impending,
under a mistaken notion of the position in which they stand. I never did
rest my defence of the Corn Laws on the burdens to which the land is
subject. I believe that there are burdens, heavy burdens, on the land;
but the land has great honours, and he who has great honours must have
great burdens. But I wish them to bear in mind that their cause must be
sustained by great principles. I venture feebly and slightly to indicate
those principles, principles of high policy, on which their system ought
to be sustained. First, without reference to England, looking at all
countries, I say that it is the first duty of the Minister, and the
first interest of the State, to maintain a balance between the two great
branches of national industry; that is a principle which has been
recognised by all great Ministers for the last two hundred years; and
the reasons upon which it rests are so obvious, that it can hardly be
necessary to mention them. Why we should maintain that balance between
the two great branches of national industry, involves political
considerations&mdash;social considerations, affecting the happiness,
prosperity, and morality of the people, as well as the stability of the
State. But I go further; I say that in England we are bound to do
more&mdash;I repeat what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[Pg 710]</a></span> I have repeated before, that in this country there
are special reasons why we should not only maintain the balance between
the two branches of our national industry, but why we should give a
preponderance&mdash;I do not say a predominance, which was the word ascribed
by the hon. member for Manchester to the noble lord the member for
London, but which he never used&mdash;why we should give a preponderance, for
that is the proper and constitutional word, to the agricultural branch;
and the reason is, because in England we have a territorial
Constitution. We have thrown upon the land the revenues of the Church,
the administration of justice, and the estate of the poor; and this has
been done, not to gratify the pride, or pamper the luxury of the
proprietors of the land, but because, in a territorial Constitution,
you, and those whom you have succeeded, have found the only security for
self-government&mdash;the only barrier against that centralising system which
has taken root in other countries. I have always maintained these
opinions; my constituents are not landlords; they are not aristocrats;
they are not great capitalists; they are the children of industry and
toil; and they believe, first, that their material interests are
involved in a system which favours native industry, by insuring at the
same time real competition; but they believe also that their social and
political interests are involved in a system by which their rights and
liberties have been guaranteed; and I agree with them&mdash;I have these
old-fashioned notions. I know that we have been told, and by one who on
this subject should be the highest authority, that we shall derive from
this great struggle, not merely the repeal of the Corn Laws, but the
transfer of power from one class to another&mdash;to one distinguished for
its intelligence and wealth, the manufacturers of England. My conscience
assures me that I have not been slow in doing justice to the
intelligence of that class; certain I am, that I am not one of those who
envy them their wide and deserved prosperity; but I must confess my deep
mortification, that in an age of political regeneration, when all social
evils are ascribed to the operation of class interests, it should be
suggested that we are to be rescued from the alleged power of one class
only to sink under the avowed dominion of another. I, for one, if this
is to be the end of all our struggles&mdash;if this is to be the great result
of this enlightened age&mdash;I, for one, protest against the ignominious
catastrophe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[Pg 711]</a></span> I believe that the monarchy of England, its sovereignty
mitigated by the acknowledged authority of the estates of the realm, has
its root in the hearts of the people, and is capable of securing the
happiness of the nation and the power of the State. But, Sir, if this be
a worn-out dream; if, indeed, there is to be a change, I, for one,
anxious as I am to maintain the present polity of this country, ready to
make as many sacrifices as any man for that object&mdash;if there is to be
this great change, I, for one, hope that the foundations of it may be
deep, the scheme comprehensive, and that instead of falling under such a
thraldom, under the thraldom of Capital&mdash;under the thraldom of those
who, while they boast of their intelligence, are more proud of their
wealth&mdash;if we must find a new force to maintain the ancient throne and
